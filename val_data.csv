0,8/2/2024 22:18,"I'm curious who the group is supporting your encampment that you cite as being in favor of two states. Because if they're supporting two states for two peoples, as I do, then they're Zionist. And my understanding was that Zionists were barred from the encampments.

Â 

I don't know what campus you are on, but here are some examples of antisemitism from university encampments. There are many more examples of antisemitism and violence from off-campus demonstrations, but let's limit this to campus for now. And before you even start, I thoroughly condemn the violent attack against the pro-Hamas protestors at UCLA.

""On April 17, a protester yelled âWe are Hamasâ and others chanted: âAl-Qassam \[in reference to the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamasâs military wing\] you make us proud, kill another soldier now!â On April 20, an anti-Israel protester on Columbiaâs campus held a sign that read âAl-Qasamâs \[sic\] next targetsâ with an arrow pointing toward a group of pro-Israel counter-protesters standing nearby waving Israeli and American flags. In the late evening hours of April 18, anti-Israel protesters who were gathered just outside the campus gates to support the student encampment reportedly screamed at a group ofÂ  Jewish students, repeatedly referencing Hamasâs October 7 attack on Israel. One protester stated: âRemember the 7th of October? That will happen not one more time, not five more timesâ¦but 10,000 more times.â Another added, âNever forget the 7th of October. The 7th of October is about to be every f\*\*\*ing day for you. You ready?â

During a speech on campus at the Columbia encampment on April 20, Tai Lee, a member of Writers Against the War on Gaza (WAWOG) who has previously expressed explicit support for Hamasâs October 7 attack at anti-Israel protests in New York City, said, âLet it be known that it was the Al-Aqsa Flood \[Hamasâs name for the October 7 attack\] that put the global Intifada back on the table again. And it is the sacrificial spirit of the Palestinian Freedom Fighters that will guide every struggle on every corner of the earth to victory.â

Also at Columbia, a sign displayed on one of the encampment tents read: ââWhoever is in solidarity with our corpses but not our rockets is a hypocrite and not one of us.â Until Victory.â

Â 

Protesters on multiple campuses have also displayed the symbols of US-designated terror groups, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Hezbollah. For example, encampment protesters at both California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt and University of Minnesota, Twin Cities displayed flags with the PFLP logo. At Princeton University, where students launched their encampment on April 25, a protester displayed a Hezbollah flag.

Â 

Protesters have also glorified figures affiliated with terror groups, such as the PFLP and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. At Columbia, protesters displayed a sign with the PFLP logo alongside an image of Ahmad Saâadat, the imprisoned general secretary of the terror group. Signs also bore the names and photographs ofâ¯convicted terrorists such as Nasser Abu Hamid, al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades; Walid Daqqa, PFLP; Leila Khaled, PFLP; Ahmad Qatamesh, PFLP; and others.â¯â¯

Protesters at Yale University, who began demonstrating earlier in the week as part of a hunger strike and officially launched their encampment on April 19, similarly displayed signs with illustrations of Walid Daqqa and Leila Khaled.â¯â¯

Â 

At the University of Michigan, where students began their encampment on April 22, protesters hung a banner next to their tents that read âLONG LIVE THE INTIFADA.â Intifada is a referenceâ¯to two historical periods in the late 1980s and early 2000s during which Palestinian terrorists committed indiscriminate acts of violence against Israelis, including suicide bombings, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people.Â 

Â 

At Columbia on April 20, protesters held signs that included such messages as âFight for worldwide Intifadaâ and chanted familiar slogans like âGlobalize the Intifadaâ and âThere is only one solution; Intifada, revolution.â

Â 

Multiple student groups â including at The New School, New York University and Emerson CollegeÂ  â advertised their encampments using inverted red triangle imagery. This symbol first gained widespread use early in the Israel-Hamas war as a way to signify, in some cases, support for violent Palestinian so-called âresistanceâ against Israel. It first appeared in propaganda videos promoted by the al-Qassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, which showed footage of Hamas terrorists attacking Israeli military targets while superimposing inverted red triangles over the heads of Israeli soldiers or other targets.""

1,8/2/2024 13:30,"It's a bit more complicated than that. Netanyahu clearly has an interest to keep the war going, however the USA and the rest of the world are doing the exact same thing. The operation in Rafah was delayed for months just because of international pressure and specifically Biden disapproving it, which caused a stalemate for months (there was barely a war for 2-3 months, most IDF soldiers were sent home) - only to eventually go ahead as planned. The USA believed Israel civilian evacuation plans were not realistic, only for Israel to execute them perfectly and even the US changed their stance.

The delay is of course convenient to Bibi, allows him to stay in power, but also Biden and the international community pressured him into exactly that and gave him a perfect excuse to freeze the war for months, while the hostages rot and die, most Gazans are away from their home, and Hamas can regroup and rebuild.

A similar thing is happening with the hostage deal. While Bibi is clearly in no hurry to make a deal (that's likely to break apart his coalition), the truth is that Hamas has not agreed to any deal that would be even half reasonable for Israel. Their demands are batshit crazy and they won't budge, which is convenient for Bibi. But if there was any reasonable deal on the table, the huge pressure to sign it (both internal in Israel and from Biden) would have forced him to go for a deal.

So basically, yeah Bibi probably wants to prolong the war, but the rest of the world is making it super easy for him. The war ends either in a complete military victory (which Biden and the international community are basically preventing by tying Israel's hands) or in a hostage deal (which Hamas prevents by making insane demands). So honestly, I don't really see how Bibi could have reasonably ended the war even if he wanted.",Pro-Israel

Nope. They just killed whoever they saw.

One is asking whether you want to take an actual hostage deal that was offered, people don't want that.

Also, they were mostly standalone assassinations while this time Israel has also been killing thousands of Hamas terrorists, commanders, has dismantled their army units, infrastructure, tunnels. This will take a very long time to recover from. And more crucially, after October 7th Israel won't be as lax again. The top priority would be to make sure Hamas doesn't rise again, there will be constant active action to discover and stop any attempts to rebuild Hamas, kill it when it's small.

The Nakba is an unfortunate result of the surrounding Arab nations declaring war on the Jews right after they gained statehood. There are varying accounts; many Palestinians were violently expelled but many also left voluntarily at the warning of the Arab nations.

And itâs not like they were innocent at that point either: the Arabs revolted and massacred Jews (both natives and refugees) throughout the 1920s and 30s, some going as far as to work with literal German N*zis. Before that, Jews in the land were treated as second class citizens for centuries.

It's the strategy of Hamas. There are two outcomes; either IDF doesn't strike a site because of the civilians near the target OR they do strike, which causes a high civilian death count for IDF. Hamas turns schools, hospitals and mosques into military bases that they fire rockets from. These buildings are protected under the Geneva convention. Striking them is a war crime. Here the world stops listening and another Hamas win. The part of the Geneva convention people ignore is that these buildings lose their protected status if an armed group carries out harmful attacks from them. Luckily an RPG isn't part of normal day attire so it's actually possible to document these attacks, despite the civilian clothing.  
  
They put their people in the crossfire, cause a humanitarian crisis (by taking aid and fuel sent in to Gaza and use it for terror purposes and their tunnels, leading to hospitals not having electricity and water not being clean because no fuel goes to the sanitizing system), they cry about war crimes, cry for ceasefire, leading to IDF having to pull back.

I've seen an ambulance bombed. I've seen convoys moving to IDF-designated areas being bombed. There is nowhere in Gaza that isn't a warzon for the IDF in practice. And before you go ""well, why don't other countries take them in?"" allow me to enlighten you that 1) that is \*their\* land to begin with, and 2) \*all\* religion is meaningless to me, so no ancient claims from a kingdom that existed 1000 years ago counts as valid ""ancestral claim"" of any kind, and as far as I'm concerned they could have built their sovereing jewish state in the middle of the Arizona desert and it would have been the exact same (minus the pointless bloodshed for the religious nonsense).",Pro-Palestine

That's why I wrote a post on the potential effects, not the merits of the accusations. Ultimately, they're not really charged with the same things, and even the actual analogy, of whether Stalin, Churchill and Truman should've indicted alongside GÃ¶ring and Ribbentrop isn't obvious. And yes, I don't agree with the initial decision to lay total siege on Gaza, morally, legally or politically. But I don't think they're comparable, if that's what you're saying. Hamas actions were simply on another level of criminality, barbarism, and open genocidal intent, even if it lead to far less damage and civilian deaths than the Israelis.

Fair enough, I read your statement above of it being appalling as a reflection of your own views not you detailing what other Israelis more broadly believed. And by the injustices they're responsible for I'm not just talking about the siege.

&gt; Going back to the seventies, Israel's allies agreed that it was allowed to fend off attempts to destroy it to a ceasefire - but no more. Anything more, even against organizations and countries that openly vowed to destroy Israel, is seen as an unjustifiable warmongering.

Not sure about other countries but I know the U.S blocked punitive actions against Israel from the U.N following their bombing of Iraq's unfinished nuclear reactor that you're talking about, and they had a positive view towards the invasion of Lebanon in 2006. More recently they just refused to talk about Israel's strike on Iran so they weren't condemning it as something like unjustifiable warmongering. If it's allowed to fend off attempts to destroy it to a ceasefire then it's allowed to win wars, pretty much none of them took up any significant issue with Israel winning the current war in Gaza for many months until Biden recently warned about an invasion of Rafah if that's what you're talking about.",Pro-Israel
30,7/7/2024 22:18,"Hey, pro tip - if you ever actually want to be taken seriously on this board or any other, maybe drop the anti-semitic douchebaggery that is accusing Israel of ""genocide"".

If you think Israel is committing genocide, you don't know what genocide is.  

People undergoing genocide don't normally have a life expectancy well into their 70s.  People undergoing genocide don't have year after year of population growth, with their population increasing by multiples over the last several decades.

The only reason to use the word ""genocide"" in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict is to apply it to Hamas' actual intentions toward the Jewish people.  That is it.  To accuse Israel of it shows not only an astonishing ignorance of the conflict itself, but a clear desire to paint Israel and Jews in general in a ""the oppressed has become the oppressor"" light, which YOU may not view as anti-semitic (and i'm absolutely certain you'll deny it is), but doesn't make it any less so.

Oxford defines genocide as ""the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.""

Israel targets Hamas terrorists, and commits an enormous amount of collateral damage to the civilian population not because they aim to exterminate them, but because Hamas does not remotely value their own civilians and uses them as occasionally convenient cannon fodder.  Militaries who value their civilians do not perform operations and hide weapons in hospitals, schools and markets, and they do not force their civilians to hide in these locations to prevent an attack.  Yet these are Hamas tactics.  How exactly is Israel supposed to avoid collateral damage while Hamas is deliberately trying to maximize it?

The situation in Gaza is absolutely nothing like Vietnam. Interdicting Vietnamese logistics along the Ho Chi Minh trail was impossible and the total war zone including Laos and Cambodia something like 1000 times the size of mere Gaza. Hamas does not have the space to hide themselves and their logistics in any way remotely approaching that of the Vietnamese, nor do they have some of the worlds densest jungles to aid in that.

Meanwhile Hamas literally has no virtually no external logistical military support to speak of and what they do get is most international food aid right now which Israel can easily shut down and should do immediately as it is only a siege if no food is allowed in and only Hamas can end the war by releasing the Hostages.

Israel attack Rafah, takes control of the Egypt border, and shuts down all food aid until Hamas surrenders, and the war will be over in around 3 months tops or so as I expect Hamas would see little point in actually letting their people starve en mass or the mass of Palestinian people will murder them and bring their heads to the IDF on a platter to save their own lives.",Pro-Israel

The, of course, '67 War--Israel made the most fateful decision in its history. It decided to privilege expansion over security. And then comes the rest of the story up til today. 

Post-'67, loyalty to Israel simply meant whatever they do we support it, even if we don't know what it is. And support it blindly, without even looking at the facts. 

My own feeling at the time--I wrote about it ... That the future, that choosing expansion over security is going to lead almost inevitably to moral degeneration, international isolation, security problems, and maybe something worse. That's just inherent in illegal rule over another people. 

You begin to internalize the justifications. So when you have your boot on somebody's neck, you make up justifications for it. And if they resist? That supports the justification.""

-Noam Chomsky

Some of the special forces that entered the Nuseirat camp in Gaza yesterday to conduct a large-scale operation to free four hostages posed as displaced Gazans from Rafah, according to local residents who spoke with the Saudi-owned Asharq news channel.

Ynet claims that the special forces belonged to Israeli units that operate in Palestinian areas by blending in with local Arabs, including speaking the language fluently.

The unit, which also included women, reportedly entered the Nuseirat camp from an area close to the American aid pier and the Netzarim corridor, an east-west passage bisecting Gaza north of the camp which has been held by the IDF and is used as a jumping off point for raids in northern and central Gaza.

The disguised forces arrived in a white car carrying mattresses on top, and the women were dressed in the clothes âthat women are wearing here in the war,â Asharq reports.

Locals asked the newcomers where they came from, and the latter answered that they were escaping the IDF operation in Rafah, and had rented a place in the area around the market in Nuseirat, pointing at the building where Noa Argamani was being held. The three male hostages (Andrey Kozlov, Shlomi Ziv and Almog Meir Jan) were detained in another building 200 meters away.

The unit then reportedly split into two groups, each heading towards one of the two buildings, in preparation for the operation.

Eyewitnesses tell Asharq that beside the disguised troops, other special forces snuck into the Nuseirat camp inside an aid truck. The IDF has denied using humanitarian transports for the operation.

54,6/20/2024 2:03,"Does it help when Hamas or Hezbollah announce where they'll attack so civilians can flee?

As you may, or, it sounds like, probably don't know, israel was founded after a 20 year foreign zionist terrorism campaign.

European zionists would blow up cafes, markets, trains, newspaper offices, hotels, they would machine gun queues of workers as they queued to enter their workplace.

You know, for their mission.  They were on a mission.  Sure some civilians had to die, but it was for their mission.

So everywhere in Palestine was continually getting bomb threats.  It paralyzed Palestine, and, importantly, it was a key part of the european zionist mission.  To destroy the stability of Palestine.

Every bomb threat by israels european terrorist founders had to be investigated.

This is all quite complicated.

The british at the time didn't know, and many modern zionists don't know something.  Haganah and the Jewish agency were a terrorist group.

For some reason modern zionists like to perpetuate the lie that the haganah had ""clean hands"", and continue to blame the ""bad"" zionist terrorist groups, ironically, like irgun.

That's ironic, because the political arm of irgun was Herut, which is now called Likud.

Do you see?  Modern zionists don't even seem to understand what they're doing or why...

You see, their false propaganda falsely white washes the jewish agency and haganah by pushing all blame on irgun, which is now...  likud, israels most popular political party...

Though, I suppose the simple answer is that they simply believe that the terrorism was justified, that zionist terrorism, like that in the Palestinian West Bank is justified.

But it's odd that they falsely white wash one group, I suppose to create a false story that the ""real"" founders of israel were MOSTLY haganah, ignoring irgun, and then they embrace the lie that haganah wasn't a terrorist group, and so they falsely white wash the history of israels founders through some dizzying selfserving ahistorical nonsense.

Anyway, so the british at the time, as well as modern zionists believed that the haganah/jewish agency weren't directly involved in the terrorism.

What the british realized that modern zionists haven't, was, that it didn't matter.

The british realized that no matter how ""clean"" the hands of the haganah or jewish agency were, they were using the terrorism, which was being carried out by the irgun (and haganah, but ignoring that) to achieve their goals.

The British, finally, after several years of violent European zionist terrorism realized that it didn't matter how solid the connection was between david ben gurion (who, for the record, was a terrorist and was actively directing the terrorist campaign), and the terrorism.

The British finally realized that david ben gurion, haganah, and the jewish agency were all using the violent European zionist terrorism to achieve their goals.  That made them terrorists.

As the European zionist terrorism escalated, there finally became a point where the British raided the jewish agency and haganah, finding evidence that, incidentally, did tie the jewish agency and haganah directly to violent terrorism.

The jewish agency and haganah then ordered the bombing of the king david hotel to destroy the evidence, ironically, directly tying the jewish agency, haganah, and david ben gurion to violent terrorism.  Though, the evidence they hoped to destroy wasn't held in the hotel, making the bombing that killed ~91 people entirely pointless.

Now, pro zionists, such as netanyahu, support the bombing, saying part of the hotel was being used by the british as the center of it's administration.  That the european violent terrorist bombing that killed 91 people, 1/3rd of which had close ties to the administration, 41 being Arab, 17 being Jewish, was justified because they, netanyahu, believed that a European zionist terrorist bombing on a government target that killed 31 people with ties to the government and 60 innocent civilians was, to netanyahu, justified.

This, of course, is wrong.  The target of the violent European zionist terrorist bombing wasn't the 31 people with ties to the government, it was what david ben gurion, the jewish agency, haganah, and irgun, believed was evidence tying ben gurion, the jewish agency and haganah to violent terrorism.  It was a terrorist attack, the goal of which was to further their European violent terrorism campaign.

The irgun/likud announced regret for the 17 Jewish people killed in the violent European zionist terrorist bombing that killed 91 people.  And netanyahu recently attended a celebration of the terrorist bombing where a plaque celebrating it was unveiled.

A warning was sent and investigated, six minutes later, the bomb exploded.

Also, I don't suppose you happen to know if racist/bigoted messages have ever been said about any other group?

About the native Palestinians, for instance?  Whose existence is denied even by the zionist ""education"" institutions, which refer to them as ""The Arab"".  ""The Arab"" responsible for, as zionists and zionist ""education"" institutions claim starting all violence ever, have no claim to any land in Palestine, and so on.

So yeah, absolutely this is a minor conflict blown massively out of proportion, primarily due to anti-semitism (the UN has always been a deeply anti-semitic body. Realize people in America complain about systemic racism when slavery ended 150 years ago, whereas the holocaust and ethnic cleansing of middle eastern jews was only 70 years ago, so obviously systemic anti-semitism still exists in all those countries). The other reason is it gives countries currently engaged in genocide (Ethiopia, Sudan, Myanmar, Russia, Syria, etc) a distraction.

International law isn't supposed to be wielded in a political fashion *ideally*, but in the case of Israel its weaponized against them politically *almost exclusively*- in ways that also are just not consistent with international law. The justification of the order doesn't even make sense, as its implying that Israel hasn't improved the humanitarian situation in Rafah since March- this is just flatly a lie. The order further implies by the way its issued then, that the court essentially doesn't want to allow the humanitarian situation in Rafah to degrade *whatsoever*, and that is not only inconsistent with international law but goes directly against its spirit.

The whole point of international law was to create rules that would protect AND keep powerful state actors accountable by developing jurisprudence that they would want to follow to uphold their image on the world stage- ***not to be weaponized against states by non-state actors***. That is, however, exactly how the ICJ is wielding that power- there is no mass slaughter of civilians or imminent genocidal action they're responding to to justify such an intense order, they're essentially advocating that pursuing the finishing of the war isn't allowed. This is especially baffling when Israel has been taking steps to minimize casualties by evacuating 1 million+ civilians while simultaneously Egypt is refusing to open *their side* of the Rafah crossing- so why in the flying fuck is the statement about the charges demanding that ***Israel*** open the crossing???

In addition to Hamas, there are several other factions in Gaza with which Iran has influence, some of which I have written about and two of the most notable being Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees, but itâs clear that Hamas is by far the most powerful actor on the ground and commands the greater international links.Â 

Whatâs less clear, however, is just how weak Hamas will be once this conflict is over.Â Israeli officials have acknowledged that every fighter cannot be killed, and even top leaders may survive, meaning Iran will likely retain some degree of influence over a group that still ranks highest in terms of support among Palestinians.Â 

Taking out Hamasâ physical rule in the Gaza Strip will certainly weaken Iranâs hand, but the prospect of a joint U.S.-Israel-Arab coalition remains quite remote at this stage. Frankly, Arab countries have very little interest in being viewed as Israelâs policemen on the streets of Gaza. The Biden administration is also particularly sensitive about putting U.S. troops on the ground. Thereâs an argument that a Trump administration could view things differently, but, based on his previous time in office, Trump has historically been more supportive of pulling troops out than sending them in.Â 

This would leave a de facto return to Israeli military occupation in Gaza, which in some ways is already the case now that the IDF has taken control of the Rafah crossing. If Israel does manage to successfully transition to a new form of Palestinian leadership, then that new leadership would likely find itself in a balancing act between Israel, Arab states and Iran.

I'd like you to tell me exactly why you think that Israel correcting it's own figures once new information comes to light is a sign of untrustworthiness rather than trustworthiness? 

Regardless, even Al-Jazeera reported that the number was revised because some of the bodies Israel found were determined to be terrorists. Now why would a Hamas militant be indiscernible from an Israeli civilian? Would it have anything to do with that fact Hamas militants dress like civilians? Hmmm...  


&gt; The one that high democratic officials come out and say we should drop a nuclear bomb on Gaza?  

Yeah the interesting part is that they don't nuke Gaza when they could. If Hamas had a nuke, do you think they'd use it?

I don't know what country you're from but every democratic country has outrageous people in government. (That's how you know it's a democracy). In the US, we recently had Lauren Boebert who told her aide that the ""jihad squad"" arrived and made a suicide bomber joke when fellow rep Ilhan Omar got on the elevator with her.

&gt;Why didn't the head of the Mossad inform the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff personally (or his office the heads of their bureaus, the military secretary, etc.)? It depends on who you ask. There is considerable anger in parts of the security sector for the head of the Mossad, who is considered the closest to Netanyahu among the heads of the services; the Chiefs of Staff Halevi and Dedi Barnea have had significant tensions for several months by now. The Mossad did not provide me with a comment, but I can assume that there they will say that Barnea is not legally obligated to update anyone except the Prime Minister and the negotiating team, and anyway, that is where Major Nitzan Alon who needs to update his superiors sits.  
In any case, there is the result: a response from Hamas arrive. The whole world is listening. Israel does not stop for a moment, and conducts an orderly discussion, in which all parties are updated. \[Israel\] doesn't say what IDF spokesman Hagari said the other night: we are studying the proposal, we would like to return the hostages, we will announce our position. The Chief of Staff, the Minister of Defense, Gantz, Eisenkot, Deri, aren't allowed to digest. Almost immediately, Israel is hit with headlines all over the world: Hamas said yes, Israel says no, Israel attacks in Rafah. And look how ridiculous it is: in any case, Hamas' proposal is unacceptable to anyone in the war cabinet. So what's the pressure. What is the urgent and permanent need from a ""senior political figure"".  
It's not technical, this behavior. Again and again there are frictions, explosions and sometimes screaming conversations about Netanyahu's decisions - to not update Gantz and Eisenkot, to set a certain outline for the negotiations in Cairo, to talk to the head of the Mossad personally and try to head for a certain target, different from the opinion of the war cabinet. Recently, Benny Gantz insisted to get the head of the Mossad on the phone, to hear from him personally that what was decided in the war cabinet is what will be presented to the Egyptians as Israel's proposal. The mistrust reigns.  
""This is his regular method,"" says a prominent source in the coalition, ""this is what Netanyahu also did on Saturday. Netanyahu repeatedly uses his high accessibility to materials, sometimes intelligence materials, to play with them in the political game and against the deal. And the reason for this is simple: the original proposal that Israel offered, which Hamas did not adopt, is bad for him politically. Ben Gvir and Smotrich will probably resign if Hamas accepts it. Gantz too, in six weeks of ceasefire with the return of the hostages, will resign.""  
As written in these pages, there are those in the War Cabinet who are convinced that Netanyahu himself is responsible for leaking Israel's minimum position, the one that was secretly prepared for negotiations with Hamas. ""And this severely damaged the entire process. Because Hamas took advantage of the minimum position now, in the response it gave. The national interest and Netanyahu's personal interest collide,"" said the same source, ""and therefore the way is leaks, briefings, even on Shabbat. He has completely lost control and has no problem exploiting the Mossad in a cynical way."" Netanyahu's people will reply that he recognized well that Hamas has no intention of a deal; that if they had gone to a military operation in the Gaza Strip two months ago, we might have had a deal today. That his briefings rescued Israel from a dark regional deal, with USA, to end the war. It is doubtful whether his fellow members in the War Cabinet buy these explanations; and they are the ones who manage the war together with him. When they're being kept up to date, of course.

These days, the mother-of-seven finds herself begging for food on the mud-caked streets of Rafah, in southern Gaza.

She tries to feed her kids at least once a day, she says, while tending to her husband, a cancer and diabetes patient. âThey are weak now, they always have diarrhea, their faces are yellow,â El Jamara, whose family was displaced from northern Gaza, told CNN on January 9. âMy 17-year-old daughter tells me she feels dizziness, my husband is not eating.â

As Gaza spirals toward full-scale famine, displaced civilians and health workers told CNN they go hungry so their children can eat what little is available. If Palestinians find water, it is likely undrinkable. When relief trucks trickle into the strip, people clamber over each other to grab aid. Children living on the streets, after being forced from their homes by Israelâs bombardment, cry and fight over stale bread. Others reportedly walk for hours in the cold searching for food, risking exposure to Israeli strikes.

First, Hamas is a terrorist organization â that is true. There are around 30,000 reported Hamas members according to the IDF, and 2.3 million Gazan civilians. Hamas have been controlling Gaza and withholding elections since 2006. They have committed horrible atrocities against Israelis.

Second of all, aid is *already* monitored to ensure Hamas does not âstealâ any resources. âIsrael currently inspects these convoys to make sure there are no weapons being smuggled in for Hamasâ (1). In the new UN resolution that I mentioned, *even more* restrictions were made to ensure that aid trucks are essentially âguardedâ by the international community. So further aid requests have next to zero chances of being âabused.â 

Next, the blockade has been imposed for 15-years. âThis blockade has severed Palestiniansâ access to vital services in Jerusalem, including specialized hospitals, banks, and educational opportunitiesâ (2). Due to the blockade, âunemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is the highest in the world, doubling from 23.6% in 2005 (before the blockade) to 49% in 2020â (2). Because of Israelâs economic restrictions, â80% of the population in Gaza rely on international humanitarian aid to survive,â which only allows a âminimal subsistence basketâ of food.

Israel originally enacted the blockade in response to Hamas terror, in hopes of pressuring a regime change. But Hamas has been abusing their power by not giving in, nor allowing elections. Thus, the blockade policies of restricting food, medical supplies, and electricity have only punished the 2.3 million non-Hamas residents, furthering their distaste for Israel and pushing them towards depending on Hamas.

Currently, there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. That is true whether you are âpro-Israelâ or âpro-Palestine.â It is just a fact. Millions of people are now refugees, without access to clean water. Hamas (a terrorist organization) said in October that they will agree to an âall for allâ exchange: Israel prisoners for Hamas hostages. Netanyahu declined. That offer still stands. 

In most recent negotiations, Hamas said they are willing to give back Israeli hostages, with the ONLY condition being 1) ceasefire and 2) aid. You might claim these are ânonsenseâ requests, but every second means a greater chance that hostages are killed â either by starvation or accidentally by IDF bombs. We can criticize Hamas all we want; yes they are horrific. But I am outraged at Netanyahu for not accepting offers that would bring them home.

70% of Gazans approve of October 7th, and a massive number of Gazans believe that it was the right move.

  
They're not only being ruled by a terrorist organization, they like it.

&gt;how can you expect the Arabs to just leave their land so easily?Â 

No one expected Arabs to leave the land, they expected them to live next to their Jewish neighbors.  They refused.

&gt;Refutation: the Israeli deal sucked; if only Barak made more concessions, there would have been peace

Are the Palestinians stuck in a bad place, or they choosing to remain there because they think that they can get more concessions over time?

&gt;Israeli left settlements, but it did not leave the minds of the Palestinians.

Ah, I see, the Jews need to stop existing to FULLY leave the settlements.

&gt;The Israelis say that the Gazan children learn propaganda in schoolbooks. This is true, but so do Israelis.

Well, you think that Jewish existence in Israel is propaganda, so sure.

&gt;Many Israelis have an irrational fear that they are surrounded by enemies that want to destroy them. Actually, Israel is far stronger militarily than its neighbors. It is Lebanon that is always scared that Israel will invade

It's not an irrational fear, and your contradiction is glaring.  They're just better at protecting themselves than the other countries are invading them.  Iran literally just launched the biggest ballistic missile attack ever launched.

&gt;Israelis do not see themselves as occupiers, even though there is a lot of evidence of occupation in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem.

The whole point is that the West Bank is occupied.  Before the war, Gaza wasn't.  By any definition.  They were blockaded.

&gt;I support the existence of a Palestinian state and if Israelis want peace they will have to find a way to live with the Palestinians, not destroy them.

[As soon as the Palestinians want to genuinely build up trust, sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnMdI_NiZvA).

&gt;Going into Rafah is a huge mistake

Leaving Gaza - remember, Gaza wasn't occupied - resulted in 20 years of kidnapping, rapes, murders, and rockets.  No thank you to that again.  Hamas hasn't left Israel any other choice.

&gt;The conflict will only end when Israel makes more steps to end the Gazan blockade and remove settlers from the West Bank.

What about Egypt, you might ask? While the Egyptian government is clearly complicit with Israel, it is not at all the primary party responsible. Israel has, since 2007, had an agreement with Egypt that gives Israel control over who and what is allowed in and out of Gaza through the Egyptian border; Israel decides how much aid is allowed to get in.

# Taken from the article: US says it opposes Rafah invasion, regardless of Hamasâs ceasefire response

The US Department of Stateâs Matthew Miller reasserted US opposition to an Israeli assault on Rafah, which he said is separate from the push for a ceasefire.

âWe cannot support an operation in Rafah as it is currently envisioned,â he said, adding that the US has not seen a credible plan to protect the 1.5 million civilians trapped in the city.

âEven absent this latest response \[by Hamas\], we have made clear that we do not support Israel launching a full-scale military operation in Rafah.â

Miller also expressed concern over Israelâs order to evacuate residents of eastern Rafah.

âIf you see 100,000 people move, youâre going to see other people in the next area move as well â which, of course, is something that you want to see happen if thereâs a military operation. But the problem now is there such limited places for them to go inside Gaza,â Miller told reporters.

âAnd there is no effective way to distribute aid to them and make sure they have access to shelter, access to sanitation in the places that they would go.â

End of Quote.

Also, here are the deets about what they agreed to so far.

""Egyptian-Qatari proposal Hamas has agreed to would include three phases, with each lasting 42 days.

A truce would begin in the first phase, along with an Israeli withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor that Israel uses to divide northern and southern Gaza.

A second phase would include the approval of a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations, and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The proposal also includes a provision approving an end to the blockade of Gaza in the third phase.""  


More deets say this ""Hamas deputy leader says US President Biden personally committed to implementation of ceasefire deal

Khalil al-Hayya confirmed to Al Jazeera that there are three phases to the ceasefire deal, but added that mediators had told Hamas that the United States president was committed to ensuring the implementation of the agreement.

There has been no confirmation of this from the American side.

Al-Hayya added that the first phase would see the return of displaced Palestinians in Gaza to their homes, and the flow of aid, fuel and relief materials into Gaza.

He added that 50 Palestinian prisoners would be released for each female captive held by Hamas in that first phase. In the second phase, Hamas would release male captives for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners.

The third phase of the agreement would include the start of the implementation of a reconstruction plan for a period of three to five years.""

Another deet from the USA

# Biden administration says ceasefire deal is âtop priorityâ for US

State Department spokesperson Miller declines to provide a timeframe for how long it would take Washington to assess Hamasâs response to the ceasefire proposal, but he says the CIA director is âliterally working on this right nowâ.

Burns has been in the Middle East since Friday to help finalise the agreement.

âItâs something that is a top priority for everyone in this administration from the president on down,â Miller said.

âEveryone is focused on this. Everyone is trying to get a deal over the line.â

Here's the process I expect a government to follow when attempting to find / capture / kill a terrorist hiding among civilians:

1. Work with the government whose civilians they are to evacuate civilians from the area
2. Work with the same government to provide security checkpoints where civilians' identities can be confirmed and they can be checked for weapons / bombs that way
3. By doing so, arrest or capture the militants in a way that minimizes civilian casualties

Now, if the Hamas militant were in Israel, Israel would have a very easy time following those steps; they could put ""Watch out for \[militant\], they are armed and dangerous! Notify authorities and flee the area if you see them,"" on signs, they could evacuate civilians, etc etc.

You do realize they are at war. Like Ukraine is at war with Russia.

Israel declared war with Hamas

As for the civilians that die, I understand your frustration.and here is mine, Hamas sucks because they use human shields and they need to be wiped off the fa e of the earth :

Hamas often uses hospitals, schools, and apartment buildings to fire their Rockets from.they admit to using human shelds:


An article by the New York Post reported that Hamas officials admitted their strategy involves using Palestinian civilians as human shields.


Captured Hamas terrorists have confirmed Israel's accusations that the group uses civilians as human shields, including positioning operation bases under hospitals.


The United States Congress, in response to these practices, passed the Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act and the Sanctioning the Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act, recognizing the use of civilians in civilian areas for military operations as a violation of international law.


President Biden acknowledged the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, noting that innocent Palestinian families, who are largely unrelated to Hamas, are being used as human shields.


Detained members of Hamas's elite Nukhba force have admitted to using medical institutions, such as Gaza City's Shifa hospital, as shields for their operations.


Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, in a televised interview, called on the Palestinian people to use the human shield tactic to defend their homes, urging the adoption of this procedure by the people .


International humanitarian law (IHL) addresses the issue of hospitals and medical facilities in armed conflict. The general rule is that hospitals should not be attacked, and this protection extends to the wounded and sick, medical staff, and means of transport. However, there are some notable exceptions and conditions:


Basic Protection of Hospitals: IHL dictates that health establishments and units, including hospitals, are generally protected and should not be attacked


Loss of Protected Status: A hospital can lose its protected status if it is being used for military purposes. It is prohibited to strike a building without knowing what it is, and attacking a structure without this knowledge constitutes a violation of IHL 


United Nations Resolution: According to UN Security Council Resolution 2286, attacks intentionally directed against hospitals are prohibited under international law unless they are military objectives 


Prohibition on Using Medical Units as Shields: The 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, in Article 12, Section 4, explicitly states that under no circumstances shall medical units be used in an attempt to shield military objectives from attack.


Acts Harmful to the Enemy: Hospitals and medical installations are protected unless they are used for ""acts harmful to the enemy."" This means that if a hospital is used in a way that harms or has the potential to harm the enemy, it may lose its protected status under IHL.",Pro-Israel

 The IDF does not enforce its rules of engagement, so calling them ""strict"" is not in line with your supposed commitment to truth. 

If IDF war criminals are ever charged, a virtually nonexistent scenario, it's an embarrassingly light sentence. A slap on the wrist. If you say you have rules but you never do anything to soldiers who break them (after you have encouraged the soldiers to break them, as the IDF command often does,) you don't really have rules. 

# These aren't mistakes; they are deliberate. 

 It's called the Dahiya Doctrine. A military strategy pioneered by the IDF. Asymmetric warfare where civilian infrastructure is deliberately targeted. It is called the Dahiya Doctrine because Dahiya is the name of a neighborhood in Lebanon where Israel targeted civilian infrastructure. This is not according to me, this is according to a former Chief of General Staff of the IDF, Gadi Eisenkot. 

I will repeat once again: This is not a mistake. This is deliberate. They are intentionally murdering innocent people and intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure. 

It was not a mistake when they told people to go to a safe zone and then bombed that exact safe zone. 

It was not a mistake when they told people to take a corridor to the south then bombed that exact corridor going south. 

It was not a mistake when the World Central Kitchen told them where they would be and asked for permission, got approved, then got bombed once, before they switched vans, got bombed again, switch vans again, and got bombed a third time. 

To argue these are mistakes, you've got to show me some SERIOUS evidence. 

&gt; However, these events have been widely condemned, and it's clear that more needs to be done to protect innocent lives.

Let's start with enforcing the so-called rules of engagement you referenced. 

&gt; If there are videos showing IDF snipers targeting civilians deliberately, these should be subject to thorough investigation and accountability.

And they won't be. This is my point. 

No, my friend. These aren't mistakes. These are deliberate. Israel has been caught lying about these things over and over. Every time there's a loud enough outcry, they come up with some dishonest excuse. 

&gt; Hamas has been documented using civilian areas for military operations,

As has the IDF. 


 &gt; The IDF places its operational centers away from civilian areas whenever possible to minimize risk to its own population, although Israel's small size makes complete separation challenging.

Gaza is even more compact than Israel. Do you think that makes it more or less challenging to separate from civilian proximity? 

# ""Reports"" are not ""robust evidence""
Alleging something is not the same as providing evidence. Saying there are eyewitnesses without saying who they are or, worse, hiding relevant information about them, are journalistic malpractice. 

## Times of Israel is not a reputable source. 
Citing a UN report bare of almost any findings that don't come from the Israeli government or military as evidence is suspect. But above that, claiming the UN is downplaying a UN report that says a full investigation (which Israel won't allow) is required because it was ""unable to establish prevalence of sexual violence"" is enough to disregard everything the person claiming to be a journalist says. Quintuple that when you learn the UN report was authored by a woman who, while writing it, expressed solidarity with Israel at EVERY MEETING SHE ATTENDED.

There is nothing of evidence in the report. There is nothing of evidence in the Times of Israel article. 

Electronic Intifada did a great piece about this, which I'll post an excerpt of here: 
&gt; Crucially, Patten and her team were unable to locate a single victim and did not speak to any alleged survivors of sexual violence or rape â despite making a public appeal for such survivors to come forward and speak confidentially and with assurances of safety and privacy.\
Notwithstanding all these limitations, Pattenâs report claims that there are âreasonable groundsâ to believe rape took place during the 7 October events. She bases this conclusion on âcircumstantialâ information which she claims âmay be indicative of some forms of sexual violence.â

### On ZAKA 
They're liars. They lie constantly. They're not first responders. They're there to collect the dead and lie about atrocity. Electronic Intifada talked about them, too.

## Israel has **NOT** made efforts to supply humanitarian aid to Gaza 
Israel has, in fact cut aid from 500 trucks per day, which was already too little, to 100-200 per day. This is in addition to Israel razing crops during the temporary ceasefire in October. Israel is intentionally starving Gaza. They are not trying to give them food. 

## Yoav Gallant is not a reputable source

&gt;Israel approves the names of Palestinians leaving the Gaza Strip, including the roughly 400 critically wounded permitted to leave for treatment in Egypt in past weeks.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Israel also inspects every truck that enters Gaza through Rafah at another checkpoint further south, adding to the backlog of getting aid in. Israel says the checks are needed to ensure no weapons enter Gaza.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite pleas for weeks by Egypt for fuel and more aid to enter Gaza, it took two weeks from the start of the war for Israel to agree on the first 20 trucks of aid to enter through the Rafah crossing on Oct. 21. It came after a visit by President Biden to Israel, in which he urged that aid be allowed into Gaza.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It was also only last week, on Nov. 18, that Israel permitted fuel to enter Gaza for the first time since the start of the war, despite Egypt's readiness to deliver fuel much sooner through Rafah.

Unless telling them what they know could risk human assets, or are an act on intel from this source ONCE but then you're probably gonna lose it as they figure out and plug the security hole type deal. Then they might be holding stuff back. 

Unfortunately I don't think the US can offer them anything that would persuade them they don't need to go into Rafah, because they almost certainly do. If the US had any ability to persuade them it wasn't necessary to go in by sharing intel they would have by now.

Fair.

Though even then, it's a mischaracterization of Israel's war goals. Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas' material capacity to challenge Israel's security, not necessarily Hamas itself. It's fairly obvious that Israel won't be able to completely wipe out Hamas, whatever that means.

&gt;We know that Israel responds to international pressure, e.g. delaying the Rafah operation, turning water/electricity back on in the early weeks, etc.

You're just saying that if Israel's strategy was to wipe out Gaza, the US would dissuade them from using that strategy. I was saying that if it were its strategy, then it could do it. I think it's a fair argument. The fact that the US might convince Israel to not flatten Gaza isn't relevant in the pretend universe where Israel is already carrying out a strategy to wipe out Gaza.",Pro-Israel

&gt;
&gt;Mr Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, born on 7 October 1952, President of the Russian Federation, is allegedly responsible for the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation (under articles 8(2)(a)(vii) and 8(2)(b)(viii) of the Rome Statute). The crimes were allegedly committed in Ukrainian occupied territory at least from 24 February 2022. There are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Putin bears individual criminal responsibility for the aforementioned crimes, (i) for having committed the acts directly, jointly with others and/or through others (article 25(3)(a) of the Rome Statute), and (ii) for his failure to exercise control properly over civilian and military subordinates who committed the acts, or allowed for their commission, and who were under his effective authority and control, pursuant to superior responsibility (article 28(b) of the Rome Statute).

155,5/3/2024 16:44,Clip like this has not been posted in months. Wonder why. Israel has been claiming it has liquidated Palestinian resistance groups in all of Gaza now and only a few battalions remain in Rafah.,Pro-Palestine
156,5/3/2024 0:15,"Israel caught red-handed lying about death toll on October 7th. Initially they said 1400 civilians deaths, incl. 40 beheaded babies.

This is patently false because the terrorist state of Israel counts IDF terrorists within their death toll. Additionally they've not provided any evidence of the beheaded babies. Once these numbers were questioned, they quickly revised the numbers to 1200 civilians, removing the count of Hamas terrorists.

This also ignores the fact that Israel themselves killed multiple civilians in friendly fire, a number experts say could be upto 20% of the civilian population.

Further updates were made to this number claiming death toll of civilians was 1068, but this again included IDF terrorists numbers. Israel has categorically blocked independent investigations, calling them ""immoral"", allowing more manipulation of information.

Final tallies released by Haaretz indicate the civilians casualties amount to 695 Israeli citizens, 373 terrorists and 71 foreigners. This does not show a clear picture yet of who were targeted by Israeli bombs, given Hamas entered with guns only by damage indicates bombing and shelling of houses and cars.

Another testimony called into question was that on October 27 by Colonel Golan Vach, head of the army's search and rescue unit, who told a group of journalists, including one from AFP, that he ""personally"" transported ""a decapitated baby"" found in the arms of his mother in the Beeri kibbutz. This was proven to be propoganda and debunked due to lack of evidence and no names identified.

The Bituah Leumi data does not distinguish between those killed by Hamas and civilians killed by Israeli forces in the fighting to retake control of southern Israel, an operation in which the army used shells and rockets on inhabited areas, according to testimonies collected by AFP and Israeli media.

This shows how the Israeli propoganda machine works, trying to shock people into reactively starting a war using absolute fabrications. This is inspite of having the attack plan for 1 year, receiving warnings from spotters and choosing to ignore these. Questions are being raised on the motivations of Netanyahu in allowing this attack to happen, to use as leverage to annex Gaza. Especially since the plan for greater Israel was presented in Oct, to the UN general assembly in September, well before the attacks.

It's done on both sides.

**UN humanitarian official notes steps by Israel to boost Gaza aid deliveries**

&gt;Schmidt/AFP)

&gt;UNITED NATIONS â The UNâs top humanitarian official for Gaza says Israel has taken steps to improve the delivery of aid to the enclave but further urgent measures are needed to increase the volume of food and other critical items needed in the territory.

&gt;Sigrid Kaag, the UN senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, tells the UN Security Council that âa paradigm shift is needed to continue to meet the immense needs of the civilian population in a safe and secure manner.â

&gt;She says this requires further scaling up âin the quality and quantity of assistance,â irreversible steps to enable the safe and unhindered delivery of aid in Gaza, and âtimely preparationsâ for projects to start early recovery of Gaza.

&gt;Kaag says she and her team have worked to launch a new streamlined land corridor from Jordan and to maximize access for humanitarian cargo from Egypt through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.

&gt;She says a âUN mechanismâ to accelerate the provision of aid to Gaza that the Security Council called for in a December resolution will start operating âin the coming days,â initially by land from Jordan and by sea from Cyprus.

&gt;She adds that âa database and notification system will go online for all cargo destined for Gaza along supply routes.â

&gt;Kaag says her team has âvery constructive cooperationâ with Israel, which she says has taken a number of steps since April 5.

&gt;She says that includes increasing the volume of aid crossing into Gaza, temporarily opening the Erez crossing and opening the port of Ashdod for humanitarian goods, increasing the number of trucks entering from Jordan and preparing other crossings to northern Gaza where acute hunger and looming famine are worst. She also cites the resumption of some bakery operations in central and northern Gaza and the repair of the water pipeline to northern Gaza.

&gt;But Kaag says other measures need urgent implementation, including improvement in checkpoint procedures and clearing humanitarian convoys as well as repairing roads and approving additional communication equipment, armored vehicles and spare parts for critical equipment.

&gt;âAgreement on medical and casualty evacuation is equally urgent,â she says, and improved communications between aid workers and Israeli military decisionmakers and âeffective and credible deconfliction âis vital for all humanitarian actors on the ground.â",Neutral

Actually it was close to the pre-1967 war borders with an offer to give them East Jerusalem.

&gt;Owned by the people, the native Palestinian people, stolen from them by violent foreign european terrorists.

Again this land had [less than a million people](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/population-of-israel-1948-present) in it with the majority being in and around Jerusalem. A lot was [purchased by the Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine) this was further split by the Arabs and Israelis under the Peel Commission, which would have given the Arabs the vast majority of the land, that they didn't accept. Also the British conquered the Ottomans, the people responsible for such 'brave' things like [the Armenian Genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide),Â [Assyrian Genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayfo),Â and [plenty of massacres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Massacres_in_the_Ottoman_Empire). This region wasn't stolen, it was liberated.

&gt;Zionists rebuilt another monument to zionist terrorism.

Good, I think we both agree it should be torn down if it is directly glorifying terrorism.

&gt;No they aren't, otherwise it would be impossible to prosecute the murder of any innocent civilian.

Seeing as how people get tried for this type of crime in international and local courts including [Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maywand_District_murders), [Congo](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congo-arrests-six-soldiers-accused-killing-civilians-2024-01-09/), [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/russian-soldiers-accused-of-killing-family-of-nine-in-ukraine), [Israel](https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-soldier-sentenced-to-18-months-for-killing-palestinian-/3733212.html), etc. Also I have yet to see a single member of Hamas tried by their government for their acts on October 7th.

&gt;By dropping hundreds of unguided 2,000 bombs that destroy everything within a 180 meter radius and kills everyone within 360 meters, and by slaughtering 30,000+ people, mostly women, pregnant women, children, and babies?

Two things, I don't accept the Gazan health ministry numbers because they include events that have been proven to not have happened, and even then the ratio is 1:5 military personal to civilians, which make Israel absolutely avoiding casualties with the [normal ratio of 1:9.](https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm) Along with [Hamas tactics](https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf) being proven to make it even harder to operate.

&gt;It was revealed in 2015 by Israeli investigative reporter Uri Blau that Menachem Livni has since received a monthly salary from the Brooklyn-based Hebron Fund, a practice of using U.S. tax deductible donations to support Jewish terrorists that is, according to Blau, verified in several other cases.

Here is something we actually do agree on, I don't really like the current Israeli government and wouldn't mind it to be reformed. I still think they're leagues above the PA and Hamas, but I don't mind them being reformed to be more neutral as they've kind of always been a little extreme.

I'd love to have another explanation which makes sense. You can't just completely ignore the murder of Palestinans by Hamas by accident.

I don't ask these questions because I'm gleefully cheering on Israel's death. I ask these questions because after **3 months,** how successful has Israel been in achieving their objectives? Have the hostages been released through bombing? Have the Hamas guerillas been destroyed? Do the Israeli people feel safer? 

There is no military solution to this conflict. There is no violence that can ""deter"" the Palestinian people.  Bibi cannot fight his way to a solution by creating more war fronts and inciting more people. The Israeli government cannot use brute military force to keep the Israeli people safe. If they could, 10 / 7 wouldn't have happened.

""The intelligence conception, which estimated that Hamas was deterred following the 2021 round of fighting. We measure it by hardware: How many Hamas terrorists we killed, how much weapons infrastructure or how many tunnels we destroyed. While they, the Palestinians, measure software. The metric to them is support in public opinion. After each round of violence, the support for Hamas and anyone fighting the occupation grows, and the Palestinian Authority, by not joining the violence, is perceived as Israel's collaborator.""

Look at all the other Arab countries. They have either crushed or expelled all their minority religion populations, except very few. Where are the Jews of Yemen.

A big problem is that I think people from the global north â â and I am not one of those â â still retain this instinctive western bias that all people are liberal rationalists. So, for example, they will by default just assume that the ""radicals"" in any given population, like Gaza or Muslims in New York, MUST be in the minority. But is there actually any evidence of that?

Where exactly are the Gazan people who did not commit rape/murder AND did not condone rape/murder?

Let's just take the rape question.

Online you can find the videos that the Hamas terrorists posted of themselves, returning to Gaza, with naked, beaten, and likely raped women...who had just been murdered or might just about to be murdered.

You can see the people of Gaza cheering, laughing, taunting, just having a really wonderful happy moment.

MORE important you do NOT see anyone speaking up.

You do not see any religious leaders, business leaders, humanitarian leaders, anyone at all speaking up and saying ""wait, stop, this is not our cause"" or ""not in our name!""

Do you honestly think that that could happen publicly anywhere else in the world and NOBODY speak up?

You have to stop this ridiculous line of distinguishing between the ordinary Palestinians (adults) and Hamas.

As I said it's racist to say ""Hamas does not represent the ordinary Gazan."" What you are saying is that ""I, as a white Westerner, think this way, and so all people in the world must think as I do.""

By the way, I am not a white westerner and I can tell you not everybody in the world thinks exactly like white Westerners.

No, different people in different parts of the world may hold completely different values for political, religious, cultural, or many other reasons.

It feels odd that I have to spell this out but obviously it is a widespread assumption, especially in the left-wing intellectual circles in the west, that all people are moderate in the majority and radicals are only in the minority.

Yet...we have no evidence that, for example, anyone in Gaza opposed rape of Jewish women.

I'm glad to hear that the kings of Oman or Bahrain or a Saudi Minister opposed it -- weeks later.

But apparently nobody in Gaza opposed it, and from what we're seeing on the streets of London and Toronto, millions of white leftists and Palestinians/Arabs are perfectly fine with the mass rape of women.

Most recently we learned:

-Hostages have been farmed out to elements within the Gaza population

-One of the hostages escaped, and then was captured by ordinary Gaza citizens, and returned to the terrorists.

-Ordinary Gazans stoning hostages

So, supposedly the Egyptian side was fine, but the Palestinian side was not.

Well, who was making the claim about the Palestinian side? [Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-bomb-rafah-crossing-to-egypt-after-telling-gazans-to-flee-through-it/):

&gt; Hamas also said Tuesday that Israeli airstrikes had made the Rafah crossing into Egypt â the only way out with the Israeli side sealed â impassable. 

Okay, so if we take this at face value, and accept that the Palestinian side was 'sealed', who unsealed it? Does anyone have news on this? Did Hamas sweep in and do some road repairs?

The [IDF](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-bomb-rafah-crossing-to-egypt-after-telling-gazans-to-flee-through-it/) doesn't admit to targeting the crossing itself.

&gt; The Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday afternoon that it hit an underground tunnel for smuggling weapons and equipment in the Rafah area, on the Egypt-Gaza border, but did not confirm or deny hitting the crossing itself.

So yeah, usual 'confirm or deny' stuff. They may have hit it. They may have even targeted it. Surely we have some videos or photos of the destruction? There should have been no shortage of reporters near the crossing shortly after the event (even on the Egyptian side).

Why wouldn't you apply the same extremely apologetic method of assigning responsibility for war crimes of Hamas then?

You'll say ""well some of them (under torture) ""confessed"" that they were given orders to rape"" - and your source for it will be IDF btw, which is completely not a trustworthy source and hasn't been for years and clearly has a motivation to demonize Hamas as much as possible.

From a preliminary investigation it appears that there was another technical fault.
Now it is already a double drama: still in Nuseirat, in a threatening area, and after one vehicle had already gotten stuck - the APC that rescued got stuck also.
The abductees, and the IDF troops were required to quickly hop into an additional rescue vehicles (third in number) that drove the abductees and fighters to the rescue helicopters.

During the massive cover fire during the retreat, more than 10 fighter jets were in the air at the same time, dropping dozens of weapons and bombs.
Among other things, the buildings where the abductees were kept were also attacked. The Air Force carried out a ""knock on the roof"" to evacuate the population, then destroyed the buildings.

Like, Jews immigrate to Palestine, buying land from absentee land owners and thus end up displacing tenant farmers who worked and lived on but did not own the land. What begins as a few solo displaced Palestinian farmers rebelling grows as more tenant farmers are moved out â Arabs begin rioting violently and killing Jews. The British respond (a bit delayed) and start killing Arabs. Jews form paramilitary groups, and some Jews work with the British to hunt down Arab rebels. The Jewish group the Irgun I believe also attacked and killed a lot of Arabs.

In 1948, the Arabs held the Jewish parts of Jerusalem in a siege. In response, the Irgun massacred over a hundred Palestinians in Deir Yassin. Many Palestinians fled their homes out of fear after that â some were forced out â and were not allowed to return once Israel was formed. Thus, in response, Palestinians from outside the state of Israel would later begin sending in bombs and hijacking planes. Later, in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Israeli armed forces would use flares to aid the Christian Lebanese army in their massacre of Palestinians.

Look at the downfall of the Oslo Accords process. Polls showed that in the early phases, most Israelis and Palestinians were optimistic about the peace process. Then an extreme right-wing Israeli shot a bunch of Palestinians praying in a mosque. And extreme right-wing Israeli assassinated the Israeli PM Rabin. Hamas terrorists began a series of suicide bombings into Israel. The Hamas terrorists, motivated by hatred, increased Israeli fear and distrust. Netanyahu was elected and increased West Bank settlement building, curfews, deportations, arrests, and torture of Palestinians â actions I believe were also motivated by hatred, even if not openly so.

 *At what point does Israelâs actions cross your ethical boundary? Does Hamasâ attack justify genocide?* 

At the point where we're actually doing what we're accused of. Right now innocenct palestinians are dying and it is tragic, but to call every act of war genocide, the word loses its meaning. Intent matters according to the definition of the word genocide. Israel doesn't target civilians, they target terrorists and terrorists infrastracture. They take extrem measures to prevent civilian casulties. They call the palestinians in gaza to evacuate, they drop leaflets. That proves to me that there is no intent to kill all palestinians.

 *Gaza has 2.1 million people in one of the most densely populated areas in the world. They arenât âhiding,â they are simply existing inside of Gaza. To play on your analogy: if you punch a bear inside a dog kennel, and the bear kills up you and every dog inside the kennel, that doesnât mean you are hiding behind a dog.* 

There are still areas that aren't populated in Gaza. And people were told to evacuate to the southern part of the gaza strip because the majority of the fight would be in the north. Hamas not only works from the most densly populated area, they work from hostpials, masques, schools. That's a war crime.

Also working from populated areas doesn't give anyone immunity because if it did than everyone would do it. 

If someone is holding a gun against your family but he's also holding a baby, you're not expected to let him shoot you because you might hurt the baby. The same thing happens with hamas and their rockets.

I have questions for you too-

At what point does Hamas actions cross your ethical boudries?

You didn't call Hamas terrorists, at what point is it justified resistance and at what point is it terrorism for you?

I think a problem with this article, and your post, is it leaves the ""so what now?"" to be purposefully ambiguous. Then each person reads into the article whatever they want and assume that THAT's what the article is trying to advocate, and each person goes off. In the end, people argue with each other based on their own interpretation of the advocacy, and everyone ends up talking past one another.

I read the full article. I made the following notes:

1. These are interviews with low level soldiers who may lack intel that superiors possess, but don't hand down. Perhaps with additional intel, their opinion could be different.

2. Everyone wants the hostages back, the disagreement is how to go about doing it and how to ensure that it never happens again. If Israel were to agree to a ""permanent"" ceasefire in exchange for full release of the hostages, there are zero guarantees that Hamas won't do another October 7 in a year (something they've already promised they will do). So long as Hamas is functionally capable of conducting military operations, Israeli's are threatened.

3. The article repeats the famously incorrect number of casualties (30,000) that has been debunked. They've also been claiming the same number since February 2024. At some point, is nobody going to point out that civilian casualties don't seem to be climbing that much anymore and that ""widespread"" civilian deaths that everyone talked about that were going to happen in Rafah never did?

4. 3 soldier interviews don't represent the IDF and certainly don't represent the majority of opinion within the IDF. I'm very interested in hearing what other IDF soldiers -- both conscripts and volunteers -- have to say about what's happening in Gaza.

And your error is that you see this as purely a Hamas problem, and you don't believe that Palestinians in general also bear some of the responsibility. Palestinians themselves have cultivated the prejudicial hatred of Jews. They've created this banquet of hate that Hamas feeds off of. They've taught their children this poison. They haven't rooted out the problem of Hamas terrorism in their own backyard because they agree with what Hamas does. There are consequences to that behavior, to that thought process.

No, It does not mean that every person in Gaza who actively hates Jews deserves to die, ***that's not what I'm saying***. But they have accepted the relatively small risk that they might die as a result of that conduct. 

If someone goes skydiving knowing the risk that he might die as a result and he does. That would be on him, he made that decision. It wouldn't mean all skydivers deserve to die. It just means they knew the risk.

245,3/18/2024 13:23,"after the 1956 coup Egypt became under a dectatorship as Gamal Abdul-Nasser was the president back then, he was a charismatic leader who was seen as the savior who will throw Israel to the sea and unify the Arab world but in reality he cares about his own image more than achieving his said goals, little the Egyptians (and the rest of Arabs) know that he doesn't only bark and don't bite, but also his regime was too fragile to protect itself from Mossad's penetration, leading to have many Mossad agents close enough to Nasser and his fellow ""free officers"" movement members.

after the war of 1967, Egypt has lost both Gaza (which used to be under his control) and Sinai, because of the incompetence of Egyptian intelligence (and other factors) this event shattered the dream of freeing Palestine and unifying the Arab world, and after his death, Anwar Saddat bacame the president, this guy despite him had been one of Nasser's close friends, he didn't share the same ambitions or ideologies, Nasser was more pro-Soviet, while Saddat was pro-US, Nasser was a Pan-Arabist while Saddat cares only about taking back Sinai and not giving a damn about Palestine.

and in 1973, Egypt was ready to go for another war with Israel, this time and with the help of Genral Shazli, the Egyptian Army was able to make a significant progress against the Israeli defense lines in Sinai. things were going fine for the Egyptians under the General's orders until surprisingly Saddat orders Egyptian forces to rush (despite the General's protests of potential defeat if they didn't stick to the plan and timing, but again it's the dictator's orders) which leads to a stalemate (while both sides claimed victory) ruining the whole plan of defeating Israel once and for all.

the US came and both of Egypt and Israel started negotiating, Kissinger (may he burn in hell) was there and was surprised to see how Saddat was so ""open"" to Israel's demands, Israel didn't want the PLO to be a part of negotiation nor want the Egyptian to mention ""Palestine"", and Saddat was like ""fine"", Kissinger (may he burn in hell) said that Saddat was supposed to be the one who demands Israelis and not the opposite, as he accepts almost all Israel's conditions, like recognizing it, forbidding the army from reaching some areas in Sinai, and finally abandoning one Egyptian city used to be called ""Oum Rashrash"" to the Israelis which is now called ""Eilat"" for strategic purposes, this ""submission"" was not only for the exchange of Sinai only (minus 1 city), but also because the US promised the Egyptian regime of giving them annual ""financial help"" once the normalization happens, Saddat was more than happy to agree and went to Jerusalem to meet with Israel's prime minister at the time. and he also showed no interests towards taking back Gaza or establishing a Palestinian state.

because of the ""annual"" help from the US, the Egyptian regime found itself in need to be in good relations with Israel, that's why Israel kept building network of spies inside Egypt in order to dominate its regime, and it was a successful attempt as Israel had access in many Egyptian facilities and ministries, the Egyptian military became a puppet in the hands of Zionists and westerners. But it wasn't all sunshines and rainbows for Saddat since he got Assassinated (either by an Islamist or an Army member).

then his vice president Hosni Mubarak came to power, he was smarter than the previous presidents, as he knew how to deal with Israelis without pissing off Egyptians, as he let the people express as much hate towards Zionists as they want, while he keeps friendly with Israel, that's why he stays in power for 30 years until 2011.

during 2011's Arab spring, Egyptians had revolted against Mubarak's regime, they had enough of sheer corruption and authoritarianism, meanwhile Israel along with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the Egyptian deep state (the military) were worried about the shift that's happening in Egypt towards democracy, because if the people start ruling themselves that means the end of military dictatorship, cutting relations with Israel and preparing for another war against it, and the spread of revolutionary ideas in Gulf states (already was in Bahrain). that's why after the first election (2012) and the win of an Islamist party of presidency, Israel, KSA, UAE, and the Egyptian deep state were preparing for a counter-revolution.

President Mohammed Morsi was the first democratically elected president in Egyptian history (hopefully not the last for so long), and he was clear from the beginning about Israel, he was anti-Israel, it's true that he didn't want to engage in a war against Zionists, but he was more than ready to support Gaza economically and socially and open the Rafah border. Also he was in good relations with Obama's administration and follows the basic protocols when it comes to dealing with the Israelis. meanwhile the counter-revolutin gang was searching for a guy in Egypt to lead the second coup, the guy was named ""Abdel Fatah Al-Sissi"" an Ambitious military intelligence member who was trusted by the elected president himself, little did Morsi know that he's gonna get backstabbed.

Sissi was planning for the coup since the 2011 revolution, he got supported by the deep state, then gained the trust of the Brotherhood party by looking ""Islamist enough"" then he secretly met with Israelis and ensure them that they have nothing to fear as long as they support him, then finally got supported by KSA and UAE ensuring both regimes that he will crush the revolution and the Muslim brotherhood (and their supporters)

The deep state started using its own media and important figures to attack the government and cause economic instability, while Israel and the UAE started lobbying in the white house in order to convince Americans to back up the upcoming coup, the KSA was financing the upcoming counter-revolution, and after only 1 year of Morsi's administration precisely during 30/06/2013, the president went to Jail with the charge of ""supporting terrorism"" (since he was in good relations with Hamas) and being an agent for (wait for it) ""Israel, Iran, and Qatar""!

General Sissi then went to crush Morsi's supporters (litteraly) like how he did in Raba'a Massacre, then he jailed important revolutionary figures that have nothing to do with Islamists, Israel approved the coup and said later that Sissi is their man in Egypt, and after almost one year of the coup, Sissi was ""elected"" to be the new president who vows to ""crush the terrorists who ruined the country"", he closed the Rafah border to suffocate Gaza even more, then his military started his own genocide against the Egyptians in Sinai (because Israel said they were all terrorists), then went and helped Israel in many occasions like striking a Gas-deal with Israel that only benefits Israelis, setting off fire in Israel using Egyptian helicopters, supporting Jarred Kushner's deal of ""peace"" in the middle east ( the word""unfair"" isn't enough to describe it), saying that ""the safety of the Israeli is as important as the safety of the Israeli"" (yes you've read that right), supporting the Abraham accords despite that it would limit Egypt's role being a mediator between Israelis and Palestinians, giving to Islands to KSA in order to make the waters international to facilitate Israel's movement in the red sea, and many more... oh and he looks REALLY happy when Netenyahu visits him",Neutral

No. Israel the state was founded on the belief that the jwsih people have a right to a state, this is a basic principle of self determination, sharign the land was always accepted (why do you think israel accepted the partition plan but the arabs rejected?)

""Villages were massacred, 750,000 displaced and ethnically cleansed, and numerous other atrocities."" 

What about the atrocites commited against the jews? gonna ignore that. Also most of those 750,000 displace fled without Jewish soldiers ever touching their villages.

*â¢ I. S. (13): Son of senior Hamas terrorist who was documented throwing stones with a sling shot towards IDF soldiers. According to his mother, the day before his death, he said âI want to go to the \[border\] and to return as a martyr in the path of Allah.â* 

*â¢ W. S. K. (14): Fatah activist who was documented at the front line of the riots. A day before her death, she told her sister âMaybe this is the last time I have with you. I may return tomorrow as a martyr in the path of Allah.â* 

*â¢ H. J. (14): Participated in Friday border confrontations and told his mother âAllah willing, Iâll become a martyr \[shahid\] fighting in the path of Allah.â* 

*â¢ M. S. (15): Body was wrapped in Hamas flag at the funeral. According to a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-linked non-governmental organization, he was shot at âapproximately 20 meters from the barbed wire fence and 50 meters from the main fence.â*",Pro-Palestine
257,3/13/2024 1:24,"Important notes here:

Blinken is _not_ in Cairo. Bill Burns is. And unlike Blinken, Burns has successfully negotiated deals in the Middle East before that lowered tensions. Indeed the timing of this acceptance seems to be designed in part to embarrass and discredit Blinken, who is widely seen as a complete Zionist stooge in the Middle East.

More specifically, the proposal Hamas is reportedly accepting is one that will end with the full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a cancellation of the Rafah offensive.

What is even more notable is that Israeli press is now confirming this concession was offered by the US to Hamas _without Israeli approval_. This has of course triggered some deranged reactions from the usual suspects, but there has also been push back from Gantz who asked the cabinet to stop leaking hysterical pronouncements (mainly regarding invading Rafah regardless of the ceasefire) in favor of reviewing the proposal first.

In short, this deal may actually have a shot of happening. The Israeli government doesn't want it, and the Zionists like Blinken are already in damage control mode over it, but if Hamas accepts then Israel will have no choice but to actually review it knowing that the US brokered the deal. So if they reject it, not only will they look like the aggressors yet again (as if anyone still believes they aren't), but they will also be actively rejecting a proposal put on the table by the country they are completely dependent on for survival.",Pro-Palestine

The value of the land the illegal ""settlements"" on is worth probably billions of dollars...

The entire purpose of them is to disenfranchise native Palestinians, to disempower them...

So how many billions of dollars do you think the ""We just want free land we don't care about peace or Palestinian suffering, we only care about ourselves, why would anyone care about anyone that's not themselves?""  or the violent zionist terrorist extremists have actually paid native Palestinians for some of the most valuable land in the world?

Ten billion?  Hundreds of billions?

Or...  do you think they use the israeli government to steal land for them?

Also there's the illegal transfer of population by an occupying military power onto illegally occupied territory.

&gt;The settlements themselves are terrorism. Why is it terrorism when hamas kills israelis, but when settlers do the same in the westbank its 'worthy of critic'?

When settlers kill in the WestBank, isn't it merely out of hate? Or is it to achieve political aims through violence? Because that's how I understand terrorism. 

And in terms of sadistic brutality (rape of men and women, murder of children, torture, removing limbs etc.) I doubt radical Jews reach that level of barbarism.   
(I know that redical Jews exist, and if I rememer right, it was one of the right-wing radical Jews who killed Rabin). I disagree strongy to compare these atrocities. 

&gt;Political islam is one of the problems. Do you seriously believe political judaism isnt? Just google ben gvir and the settlers. These are jewish extremists that are willing and celebrate the death of arabs.

I will read about Ben Gvir, thanks for the suggestion. He's in power since December 2022, So I wonder, If you don't overestimate his relevance in this.... lol  
Again, I will write it again: It's not because of radical Jews or Christians that we have strict Airport Security. So yeah, number wise and in it's force, I see political Islam as the worlds problem.   


&gt;'Mowing the grass' means the israelis know that new terroracts will happen. They bomb gaza and when they stop, they fully know that a few years later this will be repeated. The whole policy is expecting jewish deaths and its expecting even mÃ¶re arab deaths.

""Mowing the Lawn"" refers to the Gaza-Strip. I don't feel entitled to have an opinion on this strategy, as a non middle-eastern military expert. As far as I've read it, there was hope that due to that strategy military motivation will decrease. Guess that failed.

Also, there are plenty Arab-Israelis, you mean Palestinian an Israeli Deaths.   


&gt;You explicitly asked for a different point of view because you only found tiktok educated people. I studied political science and history and am invested in this conflict, so i'm here to share my opinion on this.

I didn't ask for it. But in your case, I'm quite happy. You gave some interesting insights and didn't scream in my face ""what about the dead children though"". So thank you.

&gt;My point is that both sites commit atrocities. Hamas must get rid of, but so must netanyahu and israels largely right-far right governments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tell palestine and the arab states with influence that they have to hand out hamas leaders so they can get killed or inprisoned and as soon as that happened, negotiations for a 2 state solution is on the table.

That is what's happening, isn't it? They get rid of Hamas.   
Netanjahu will fall after that, as far as I am informed. No? Ultimately, it seems clear that he won't stay in power for too long anymore. 

What worries me here, is if it will be possible to denazify the Palestinians. Because of Islam, it seems like this process won't be as easy to achieve as in Germany after WW2. 

&gt;Thats basically what the whole world tells israel, but the current government doesnt care because they dont gain anything from that.

Excuse me? The last part is unclear to me. As I see it: Right now, Israel is in the phase of getting rid of Hamas (and getting back the hostages). no?   
And for the second part of the operation - the denazification. I assume, the Israeli Intelligence will have a plan for this. But anyway, right now, the phase is ""getting rid of hamas"".   
What I worry is: Turkey f.e. said, they will offer Hamas Terrorist Shelter. The EU is failing atm, but the soon incoming corrective right-swing, will most likely deal with that issue.

For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.â

Bevinâs description of the âirreconcilable conflictâ is telling. He does not argue that the Jews and Arabs in Palestine canât agree about how to rationally and fairly divide the land. He explains that the Jews want a state â of whatever size â and that the Arabs want the Jews not to have a state at all. This is an existential conflict by definition, as it involves the very existence, rather than the size, of the state of the Jewish people. Such a conflict is indeed irreconcilable, barring the annihilation of the State of Israel, and as Bevin concluded, âThere is no prospect of resolving this conflict by any settlement negotiated between the parties.â""",Pro-Israel

No, that in no way indicates the general intent of ""Palestine will be free"" is genocidal.

2. Palestinians, like all human beings, deserve civil rights. No, the safety of Israelis does not take precedence over the civil rights of Palestinians. The argument that one group's safety is more important than another group's civil rights has been made many times throughout history, for example in Apartheid South Africa and during the Japanese internment in the US World War 2. Every single time that argument has been made it's been recognized as racist and it's often used as precedent for crimes against Humanity. If you disagree then please cite a single historical example where it was considered acceptable to sacrifice the civil rights of one ethnicity for the safety of another.

3. This is a huge understatement. 38 Israeli children died on October 7th. 13,000 children have died in Gaza. You'd have to be an extremist to see that as proportionate.

4. Egypt's blockade is a huge problem and it's part of a coordinated effort by both Israel and the United States. But I agree, more people should be pushing back on Egypt's complicity in the human rights catastrophe in Gaza.

5. Far more Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in recent years than Israelis, and any attempt of the Palestinians to violently resist settlers in the West Bank has been labelled ""terrorism"". If you disagree then please point to examples of violent Palestinian resistance against Israelis that you don't consider to be terrorism. 

6. There is no due process and torture is used (including on children) to extract confessions. There is no basis for assuming that all of the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails committed terror, unless you happen to believe all Palestinians are terrorists.

7. Many human rights organizations (including the Israeli B'tselem) call Israel an apartheid state. No one disputes that there is ethnic discrimination in the occupied territories, people dispute whether it's technically apartheid (which it absolutely is) but not whether it's any less immoral.

Notice that the hard right in Israel has around 10 seats out of 120 in the Israeli parliament, while genocidal elements in Palestinian society get the backing of more than 70% of the population. In other words, Palestinian actions are further radicalising Israelis. Israel is under no obligation to convince the Palestinians to be good neighbours. They are a people with agency and can decide for themselves whether they will do so or not, just as they decided to participate in Oct 7th along with the armed Hamas terrorists and hide hostages in their homes. 

Personally I believe the 2SS will only work if the Palestinians demonstrate that they are de-radicalising and are willing to live in peace. Until that happens, Israelis will further entrench themselves in the belief that Palestinians will be a forever hostile entity that needs to be dealt with.

Actually there are literally millions of people saying that Hamas are not terrorists so you are incorrect there, but let's take your argument that you should not go after terrorists if civilians are in the way. How do you propose that Israel defends its own citizens? Serious question because if I thought there was any other way to protect civilians in Palestine and Israel, I would 100% be for it. And please don't say that it's not by doing what they're currently doing, because that's not an answer. I have posed this question to dozens and dozens of people online and literally not one person can answer it. This current war is an absolutely horrendous situation for any person or government to have to decide what to do and how to protect its people. I am not okay with any civilians dying, which is why I agree that Hamas needs to go. They have a track record of murdering their own civilians as well as Jews. Their charter literally calls for the eradication of Jews, not Israelis, but Jews and yet you've got so many idiots in the West propping them up as ""freedom fighters."" Please tell me one way that Israel can protect its citizens without any civilians dying, I would honestly love to know. Hamas has stated on television that they will continue to do October 7th over and over and over again. Lest we not forget that Hamas is still holding over a hundred hostages who we know they enjoy torturing. Please tell me how you propose that a country live side by side with a terrorist group committed to their complete annihilation and who isn't afraid of using their own civilians as human shields. Again, the IDF has gone above and beyond what any other country has ever done to protect the lives of ALL civilians. If I am wrong, then prove it with evidence, but simply calling for a ceasefire WITHOUT a plausible solution that protects ALL civilians is inherently antisemtic. Israel would not be in this war if it were not for Hamas. The blood of all innocents is on Hamas. Just look at the history of all the wars that Israel was ever involved in. Not ONE of them was started by Israel.

You cannot say that Israel has ""killed 15,000 innocent lives on their way to Hamas."" As you just agreed above that Hamas is a terrorist group, who do you think is putting these numbers out there? Hamas is the elected governing body of Gaza. This is a fact that can be easily verified with a quick Google search and there is no misconstruing this fact. When you see an article quoting the ""Palestinian Authority,"" they are quoting Hamas. Do you think terrorists draw the line at lying? Gang rape, beheadings, and burning people alive are okay, but not lying? On the other hand, the IDF has stated that it has killed thousands of Hamas agents. Have you noticed how not one statistic of people dying in Gaza mentions who is dying? In other words, Hamas is putting out numbers of deaths that haven't been verified by anyone but them, and they refused to state how many of these deaths were Hamas terrorists and how many were civilians.

But let's assume that these numbers are correct for a moment. You ask why the IDF can't do what no other country on the world has ever done and avoid civilian deaths in the middle of a war. Okay, well one they are not inhuman or magicians. Two, Hamas has a long documented history of using their own civilians as human shields. The fact that Hamas openly told their civilians not to evacuate south when the IDF asked them to is very indicative of this. The fact that the IDF keeps finding weapons under hospitals, schools, children's beds, mosques, etc. is also indicative of this. The fact that one of the heads of Hamas went on television and publicly stated that their tunnels are for their Hamas operatives only and that it's the UN's responsibility to protect their own citizens is, again, indicative of this.

The IDF does not know where ALL the terrorist tunnels are. Please provide a source for this. On top of that, even if they somehow did know (which they don't), those tunnels are littered with booby traps meant to kill the IDF. Destroying a terrorist group isn't as easy as you seem to think it is. If it were, the US wouldn't have spent 10 years in a war in the Middle East. If the IDF wanted to wipe out Palestinians, they could have destroyed the entirety of Gaza with 1 bomb and not lost any of their own soldiers. You make ignorant claims with no proof or evidence to back any of it up. Please explain your military background to me since you seem to think that military operations are quite simple and quite black and white.

Because Hamas embeds themselves and their arsenal into civilians homes. Again, this is all thoroughly documented online and can be verified with a quick Google search. You are just making the same argument over and over again with no different points. Israel is bombing Gaza and civilians are dying. That's not okay. Israel should stop because civilians shouldn't be killed. Please answer the question. How can Israel protect ALL civilians? Again, if you cannot answer that question and you continue to call for a ceasefire then you are saying that the lives of Israelis/Jews don't matter.

Believing in the sanctity of life and using lethal force to defend one's nation from genocidal attackers is not mutually exclusive. Israel hits back when attacked. That's the right move, and their history supports this, because in the past passivity led to catastrophe. Committing genocide against Israel must have a cost, and it should be high.

&gt; What makes you think other people do not think the same way?

Of course they do, game theory is a thing and if you're playing international politics properly you're considering it when making decisions. The most important difference is that every time violence/intifada is chosen, Israel wins and Palestine loses more and more. If they could win through violence this would be a different situation entirely. They've tried intifada unsuccessfully for the better part of a century and they're all out of ideas.

323,2/12/2024 10:51,"So first it's important to understand where the phrase ""from the river to the sea"" comes from, and what it means to different groups of people.

PLO 1960s: The phrase was coined by the PLO back in the 1960s, calling for the liberation of Palestine, at the expense of destroying Israel. The PLO back then was a terrorist organization, that went around hijacking planes, blowing up civilians, buses and cafe shops.

Hamas 2017: In Hamas's revised charter in 2017, they have the phrase ""from the river to the sea"" which calls for destroying the ""Zionist Entity"" aka Israel, and ""liberating Palestine"". In their charter, paragraph 2, Hamas defines the whole of Palestine as: *from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean sea, to Ras al-Naqurah, to Umm al-Rashrash*. For those unfamiliar, they should check Google maps.

Westerners (who knew little to nothing about this conflict prior to Oct 7):

Will think it means just giving Palestinians a state, free from oppression, free from economic blockage, right of return (sometimes).

But what they don't understand, is that phrase has a very different connotation to Hamas, a very different connotation by the PLO, who popularized it. So when someone says to an Israeli ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"", it's very scary because Israelis know it by what their neighbors mean by it, not some Westerner living 3000 miles away.

edit: It's like if I started yelling some Stalin quotes, and people who had parents/ancestors who suffered during Stalin's reign told me that's messed up, it would be ignorant and disingenuous of me to say ""Oh no that's not what I mean! I'm simply calling peace and liberation!""",Pro-Israel

The IDF cleared the event for publication on Monday morning.

Issa was reportedly hiding in Nusirat, in central Gaza, at the time of the strike, and it is unclear whether the Hamas leader was killed in the event.

*Maariv,*Â citing Palestinian sources, reported that Hamas was concerned about the status of the terror chief.

  
Separately, in central Gaza, [the IDF](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/2024-03-11/live-updates-791272) eliminated 15 terrorists through close-quarters engagements, sniper fire, and airstrikes, the IDF stated on Monday.

  
In one encounter, Israeli troops identified a terror cell carrying what were suspected to be weapons out of a Hamas military compound in the area.

  
The IDF similarly eliminated another terror cell that was observing the Israeli troops in the area.

  
The Israeli forces also operated in the area of Hamad in southern Gaza, where special forces units conducted raids on a number of civilian residences that were being used for terror purposes, the IDF reported.

During these raids, the IDF troops arrested [Hamas terrorists](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-791194) and found weapons, ammunition, and other military ordnance. In one operation, an anti-tank missile was launched at the soldiers. However, no injuries among IDF personnel were reported as a consequence.

Later, Israeli troops identified, engaged, and killed a terrorist in close-quarters combat after he moved out of an area from which the anti-tank missile had been fired.

Off the coast of the northern portion of the Strip, Israeli naval forces also engaged terrorist operatives by targeting a vessel used by the Gaza terror organizations.

The reason why I feel this way isn't because its not true that the two are ti a degree related (as what you said is true, Palestinian men do make up Hamas) but because when the two are put in the same sentence or treated as one in the same, people use that to justify what is happening to Palestinians claiming that it is ""preventitve"" and that they're keeping themselves ""safe"".

As for Hamas being re-elected by Palestine, I highly doubt that Palestinians would democratically and fairly vote Hamas into power by will. There is no democracy in Palestine, not real democracy anyway, and so I don't believe that through politics, Palestine has any power against Hamas.

I'll admit that it did give me hope when I saw the Israeli protests against the current government and the demand for Netanyahu to step down. That man is out for his own agenda and treats the deaths of foreign aid workers as less than collateral damage and a small nuisance. However, what's disheartening is realising that when interviewed, many Israelis were against the current government solely because many of the hostages have not been returned yet and they're fed up. Whilst the hostages are also a pressing issue and it's appalling that the rest of them haven't been returned yet, the fact that the IDF assault on deaignated safe zones in the Palestine weren't mentioned was concerning. Basically- Israeli society is still over looking a growing problem and crimes that their government is doing in their name, whilst a large amount of Israeli society is becoming increasingly extremist.

If I have a double standard, I don't believe the doube standard had stemmed from hate. Instead, I think it stands from what I see, what contradicts my morals, and what is inhumane. Such as the October 7th attacks. Such as the assault on Gaza hospitals, because apparently that's the ""only way"" the IDF know how to defeat Hamas.

I've heard far too much disregard for Palestinian lives from Zionists. I've personally heard more Zionists speaking about Gaza like it's packed full of vermin who need to be exterminated than the other way around (I realize extremist groups have made equally disgusting statements, I just haven't heard it directly being in the western world).

I've heard language on the left here (twice now, which is too many) commending the Hamas ""resistance"", which is incredibly upsetting to hear (while not being directed at Jews), but the language I've heard from Zionists here in Canada/U.S. has been so much worse, and often *is* directed at Muslims, Arabs, Palestinians, and just so, so devoid of empathy.

This attitude that ""jihadists on the other side"" are the source of the real danger is something I can understand on an emotional level (obviously there are a number of groups willing to engage in acts of terrorism that will cause loss of life to uninvolved civilians). But looking at it purely objectively, Israel has been so much more effective, deadly, and calculating when it comes to actual death toll, and I'm unwilling to side with them just because I may be more closely related to the Israeli population. Tribalism is what started this problem in the first place. No one in power (on either side) is seemingly even trying to approach the issue with radical empathy, and I think peace will be impossible until that happens. Israel seems like they'd sooner kill everyone in Gaza than do something ""extreme"" like trying to cautiously relocate and integrate civilian families who haven't been involved with Hamas from Gaza to Israel, and I don't think there's anything Hamas could even do besides surrendering to stop the bleeding of civilians, which they understandably won't do because... (in addition to their instincts for self-preservation), Israel has never done anything to indicate anything will change on their end.

It's like Gazans have spent their lives backed into a corner, having been unjustly imprisoned, marginalized and brutalized their entire lives. Then an insurgence forms and carries out a deplorable act of terrorism on Israeli soil, but it's also the only time  in most of their lives they've seen anyone successfully strike back at the ""oppressors"" (in actuality, mainly peaceful people on Israeli soil who were probably as far from being the guilty parties as you can find in Israel). Not that most Palestinians know better one way or another.

Hamas publishes a release lying through their teeth, claiming their resistance was nonviolent and the casualties were almost entirely from IDF actions (and IDF downplays that their response probably *did* cause 10-20% of the non-Hamas casualties over 10/7-8). People in Gaza who already have limited internet access and are surrounded by Hamas propaganda see the IDF move in and start bombing them to shit. Like, what chance do they even have? They only nonviolent path to escape the chaos in Gaza is basically to roll over and let the Israeli terrorists put an end to the suffering you've been subjected to your entire life, or let the Hamas terrorists use you as a disposable tool in urban warfare.

Palestinians were there the entire time. They're descended from the same people as the Jews who were displaced. Jews did not magically appear in the Mediterranean. To the extent that gives you ""real legitimate ownership"" (nonsense), they have exactly as much claim. The only difference is if you accept a God's chosen people framing. Additionally, the Jewish state you're deriving legitimacy from doesn't exist anymore and hadn't existed for like a thousand years by the time Zionist terrorists claimed to reestablish it. If that grants legitimacy to any cooked up state, we can look back and establish a hundred other ethnostates, displacing people who live there now. It is obviously a poor argument, and any fact you give that doesn't address that deficiency leaves Israeli land grabs illegitimate. 

# But there are 23 Arab states! 

And not a single one of them was formed as an ethnostate by displacing anyone who wasn't Arab. There's a difference between having a demographic majority and having an ethnostate dedicated principally to that ethnicity's interests. 


# It's not a genocide with ethnic cleansing.

Yes, it is. It is a straightforward case of genocide. Israel complaining about it is not a legal analysis. There are elements in plain language and Israel plainly meets those elements. You can cry about it all you want, but there is a mountain of evidence that this is a genocide. Israel bulldozed farms during the temporary ceasefire in October. Israel dropped food aid trucks entering Gaza from 400-500 per day to less than 200 per day. This was after Israel's keeping Gaza ""on a diet"" where they limited calories going into Gaza. Many (MANY) of Israel's leaders have openly stated their goals for settling the land with a Jewish majority. That's ethnic cleansing. That's genocide. 

# But the population didn't drop! 

There is obviously no requirement in the elements of genocide that the population experience a huge drop. There are cases of genocide where the population rose and cases where the population fell. That is not a defense to genocide. That said, I think Palestine's population has dropped, we just can't actually count the bodies yet because Israel won't stop killing the civilians who do the counting.

Systematic rape during a war, remember, is considered an element of genocide. Thereâs evidence Hamas terrorists were ordered to rape Israelis. Israel and Ukraine, in contrast, abide by the Geneva Convention. They generally treat captured enemies with dignity, and try to avoid hurting civilians as much as possible. 

Like Israel, Ukraine is merely defending itself against a godless enemy unworthy of the title human. Itâs not surprising that Putin is pro Hamas. The same Putin who took Hamasâ side in the Gaza war when he invited their leaders to visit Moscow after the October 7 attacks.

3. I'm talking about long before the occupation here, I mentioned the example of haj husseini claiming jews want to destroy al aqsa and rebuild the temple, this type of rethoric is also still alive today in the arab world, and it's nothing short of a blood libel.

The hebron massacre of 1929 happened because of this libel.

 the hamas Terrorist attack was literarly called ""Al Aqsa flood""

The 2nd intifada was primarily fueled by sharon's visit to al aqsa and yasser arafat encourged the idea of Al-Aqsa being in danger.

But I will say sharon's visit was just a provocative move and he is a dumbass for thinking it would end well but he didn't have any intentions to damage or threaten it.

* the young Democrat base is almost exclusively and very fanatically pro-Palestine (to the tune they riot in front of ordinary Jewish restaurants, as if some random Jew has anything to do with the Netanyahu government?!)
* he needs the Palestine war effort as leverage against the Republicans to get support for Ukraine passed (basically, we support Israel, and in turn you support Ukraine)
* the US and European economies need the war gone because until it's gone the Houthis will keep threatening merchant ships on their way through the Suez canal, thus making deliveries from China to Europe more costly and delayed
* the last thing the world needs at the moment is an escalation involving Israel's neighbors (especially Hezbollah in Lebanon) or, even worse, a collaborative war effort of MENA countries against Israel because that may escalate the entire situation into something that makes the Syrian war look pale

As for the IDF, they don't want ground efforts because, surprise, ground efforts in urban warfare scenarios against not just military targets but also a highly hostile civilian population are among the most deadly offensives any military can face.

And finally, Netanyahu himself is pretty stuck either:

* the moment the war is over, he's out and probably heading for prison. The Israeli population is *pissed off*.
* His far-right coalition partners and their civilian allies (aka, fanatic settlers) keep sabotaging the efforts whenever they can, especially the ICJ hasn't taken too kindly towards what various ministers have spouted in public or what fanatic settlers and some IDF members completely gone off the rails have done
* there's no way to get the hostages unless either Hamas cooperates (very unlikely) or Hamas is exterminated

Lets take hamas death count at face value which is 32k. (10k unconfirmed, aka they only have actual proof of 22+-k)

12k of those are confirmed terrorists, aka people shooting rpgs from hospitol windows.

Do you assume 15k children died because gaza population is 50% children? Most kids dont go out shooting with a machine gun and sucide belt.

Hamas currently has only 4 battalions left standing in rafah, The rest are scattered. You can absolutly destroy hamas and thats exactly what has been happening.

2. Actually very interesting, I was not aware of the IBC. I went on their website and using their '/database' page, I selected to view all civilian deaths caused by 'US-led coalition incl. Iraqi state forces' and the number it shows is 24,824. Can you please clarify where did you bring that 15,000 figure from?
3. That's a very niave opinion. As much as we would all like that in our fantasy worlds, in reality we know very well that the moment Israel declares a zone in Gaza it won't attack, Hamas will immediately rush to that area and reorganize it's troops there and launch further attacks at Israel from there. In order to dismantle Hamas, Israel must attack them **where ever** they may hide in Gaza.
4. I didn't say Israeli settlers were unarmed, I said they have no control over Palestinians.
5. They should be removed from government and power. Sadly, Israel is a democracy and these people were, unfortunately, somehow, beyond my understanding, elected or appointed; which means getting rid of them won't be so simple. (Netanyahu won't remove them because that would mean the end of his coalition, and thus the end of his current term, why would he do that).

410,1/1/2024 18:47,"&gt; Why do you think it has taken the UN until now, 8 months into the war, to warn about the widespread looting and smuggling that is commonplace with aid deliveries in Gaza?

A few reasons:

1.  They didn't want to distract from the lack of aide getting in.  Now that aide quantities are way up they are turning to the 2nd problem.  Had they discussed this before it would have (from their perspective) shifted the issue on getting it in. 

2.  The problem is getting much worse.  Local violent gangs not affiliated with Hamas are emerging.   Israel is breaking Hamas as the government of Gaza and creating effectual anarchy.  

3. Part of the narrative from the UN is this is a genocide not a war since Israel can't win.  Demonstrating the collapse of Hamas' ability to govern is demonstrating that Israel is winning.  That was particularly important in arguing that Israel should not go into Rafah. 

&gt; What do you think would be the best way of alleviating the food shortage in Gaza? 

Israel taking control and directly occupying.  Israel provides services to the civilian population. Kick the UN out and do the work.  UNRWA, WFP... are moderately hostile.  They will remain moderately hostile and undermine Israeli policy if given the opportunity. 

&gt; Do you think it is fair that the UN has been blaming Israel for a famine for months now, even though most of the holdups are occurring on the Gaza side of the border to the UNâs inadequacies, as they have now conceded after 8 months?

I wouldn't say most of the holdups are the UN's doing.  It wasn't the UN that closed down the largest 2 border crossings, didn't provide safe aide routes, didn't provide safe distribution centers...   The UN's messaging is terribly unfair to Israel.  They should be considered an enemy.  OTOH at the end of the day, the reason there isn't mass death in Gaza from starvation is primarily UN affiliated organizations.

- The average Palestinians and pro-Palestinians believe Israel is inherently evil and should be destroyed.

- The average Palestinian and pro-Palestine think that being neutral or supporting Israel makes you a terrible person who doesnât care about Palestinians.
- The average Palestinian and pro-Palestine struggle to accept that there are people who disagree with them or might view the conflict differently than them. Thatâs why they often attack or demonize anyone who is Pro-Israel or a Zionist.

- The average Palestinian and pro-Palestine strongly support and believe in the the slogan âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,â which calls for the ethnic cleansing of Jews and destruction of the only Jewish state. (Antisemitic) 

- The average Palestinian and pro-Palestine reject a two-state solution and firmly believe only in a one state solution (Palestinian state) while Jews should âgo back to Europe.â

- The average Palestinian and pro-Palestine see the conflict as a clear-cut battle between good (Palestine) and evil (Israel) with no room for middle ground.

- The average Palestinian and pro-Palestine is antisemitic. They call Jews âZionist PIGSâ compare them to Nazis, and attack Jewish individuals outside of their homes, synagogues, schools, and even at pro-Palestine rallies. 

- The average Palestinian and pro-Palestine lacks empathy for Jewish victims of the conflict and they often deflect when confronted with Palestinian violence against Israelis. Their usual arguments is âBut what aboutâ¦(proceeds to talk about Palestinians) Because they firmly believe that Palestinians are the only victims and good people here, and no one should mourn Jewish lives since in their eyes âPalestinians have suffered more.â 


- The average Palestinian and pro-Palestine tokenize anti-Zionist Jews as the âreal Jewsâ and dismisses the Jews who support Israel by saying theyâre not âreal Jews.â As if thereâs only one correct way to be a Jew.

Even with that being the case, however, I think there is a red line in terms of civilian casualties that people would not cross to kill the terrorists.

&gt; Annihilation is a military strategy in which an attacking army seeks to entirely destroy the military capacity of the opposing army. This strategy can be executed in a single planned pivotal battle, called a ""battle of annihilation""

There is a German term âvernichtungskriegâ that translates into âwar of annihilationâ which the WW2 German government used a lot, and in that case their aim was actually not dissimilar to the Israeli aim: complete destruction of the enemy state; overthrow of the enemy government; no negotiation with the enemy, but I was moreso referring to annihilation the military goal.

Also itâs a very weak argument to say âif Israel wanted annihilation, it would have flattened Gaza.â We know that Israel responds to international pressure, e.g. delaying the Rafah operation, turning water/electricity back on in the early weeks, etc. So we can simply explain the decision to not flatten Gaza by the fact that Israel is cognizant of the international pressure and especially US pressure it would face if it just flattened an area with 2M people in it.

452,12/19/2023 13:00,"""How was it that there were Palestinian refugees in Jordan in 1970, if they had left Israel in 1948? Twenty-two years after âNakbaâ they were still ""refugees.""

King Hussein bin Talal always kept the displaced Palestinians in concentration camps, as did all the other Arab countries of the time. Instead of absorbing them into Jordanian society, they were kept in inhuman conditions in concentration camps to pressure Israel and the United Nations. Nobody wanted the ""problem"" of Palestine to be solved. Oh, of course there were also Jewish refugees from Arab countries! Hundreds of thousands of Jews had to flee Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Algeria, Tunisia, Yemen and Morocco with nothing, leaving behind all their belongings and properties... But Israel did not put them in camps. They were easily absorbed by Israeli society and today, one or two generations later, they are lawyers, doctors, professors and university professors in Israel. The problem no longer existsâ¦ The problem of ""Jewish refugees"" no longer exists. This could have happened to the poor Palestinians if King Hussein in Jordan, Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt and Shukri al-Kwatli and Hafez al-Assad in Syria had done the same.

King Hussein of Jordan began one of the bloodiest battles against the Palestinian people in what would be known as ""Black September."" He was firmly determined not to allow the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), under the leadership of Yasser Arafat, to take over the government of Jordan or even the government of the Left Bank. And he was probably right, since this would have threatened the autonomy of the Hashemite Kingdom. His father-in-law, with the loyal help of the Jordanian Armed Forces, killed thousands of Palestinian refugees at gunpoint. It was not a long war: it ended in July 1971. But according to Yasser Arafat, about 20,000 Palestinians were killed during Black September.

So, Kingdom of Jordan and Arab countries has played an important role in creating the situation in Gaza, where Hamas terrorists launch thousands of rockets on Israeli civilians and then use Palestinian children and women as shields.",Pro-Israel

You got destroyed in 2006 against Hezbollah in a crazy odds war, again because your air force couldnât really damage Hezbollah, they bombed civilians in other areas of Lebanon as a way of pressure (typical Zionist terrorism).

458,12/17/2023 6:48,"As to the first question: Israel has not destroyed Palestine as a state. You cannot destroy what does not exist. That being said, Israeli civilian settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are illegal and most supporters of Israel (as well as a significant share of the Israeli population, including the Jewish population) opposes these settlements. Even the man known as the ""father of the settlers"", former Israeli PM Sharon, came to the conclusion that some settlements had to be dismantled and won elections on that basis. The problematic bit of that chant is not the bit about ""Palestine will be free"", but the one about ""from the river to the sea"", as Palestine cannot extend from the river to the sea, as Israel is in between the Palestinian territories adjacent to the river (West Bank) and the sea (Gaza).

As to the second question: Hamas is (among other things) a terror organization, on account of engaging in terrorism was an organization. The IDF is not perfect, but it is a regular armed force that makes at least some effort to adhere to international law standards. The IDF never held any civilian hostage, they detained people, including civilians (which an occupying power may do). Nor does the IDF - apart from individual soldiers, who are (albeit sometimes with lackluster effort) prosecuted and punished for their misconduct - knowingly target civilians (but the IDF applies the definition of combatants rather generously, at times not in accordance with international law). While I would not exactly classify the IDF as ""the most moral army in the world"" or even as above average in terms of morality (more like lower midfield) it is not by a longshot morally equivalent to Hamas.

As to the third question: While I have a hard time to feel overly compassionate for any adult Gazan, I am not a believer in punishing children for their parents' sins, no matter what they are. With regard to the adults, their moral fault is not primarily in electing Hamas as far as I am concerned. The problem is that they have been accepting Hamas rule ever since. And, yes, they could have done something about it. At the very least, they could have informed on Hamas members. Hamas is not some secretive organization. People know who is an affiliate. Just contact the Israeli authorities and tell them about your neighbors and relatives who are Hamas affiliated, then stay clear of them while Israel takes them out.

Because I have distance from the conflict and my life isnât threatened, probably explains why I am more open to the Palestinian side although I consider myself a centrist or liberal Zionist. 

My sense of many Israelis is that they donât quite understand the Palestinian experience, or fully appreciate Palestinian national identity (Arabs are Arabs basically). The trauma of Second Intifada and 7 October has cemented the idea that âthere is no one to talk to.â 

Itâs interesting you state that Mizrahim are more western than middle eastern at this point. You are probably correct but many other Israelis, and certainly American Jews, would view Mizrahim as very middle eastern. I suppose it all comes down to perspective or what your frame of reference is. Israelis, especially Mizrahim, to me, come across, if not as Arabs (who are typically quite polite in my experience) certainly âeastern Mediterranean.â

Would Israelis knowing Arabic and Arab culture help? Maybe, Iâm not sure. Could it radicalize Israelis further depending on what Arabs and Arab media are saying? âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be freeâ sounds a lot less threatening than

Most people also have neither the time nor resources nor ability to learn so much about the conflict, history, and the âother side.â All I could say, if I were in charge of Israel, would be to respect Arabsâ sense of pride and to limit friction as much as possible between Israelis and Palestinians. I donât think any Israeli leader could agree to a Palestinian State tomorrow, but there are ways to limit or correct some of the more egregious abuses of the military occupation.

499,12/10/2023 22:24,"You make important points about the different factions within the Pro Palestinian advocacy movement. I think the usage of the term ""intifada"" varies among organizers. I believe most are calling for a collective struggle against oppressive forces not just in Israel/Palestine, but around the world; the struggle would respect the right for revolutionary groups to take up arms in response to being subjected to violence themselves, as it is argued that this would be the only means to carry out an actual shift in power. This argument in itself can be endlessly debated. For example, what is the moral red line that armed resistance should refrain from crossing? How does a new power paradigm built on violence prevent oppressive forces from resurfacing? Many advocates who use this term just seem to have a glorified vision of revolution, I doubt most of them actually deliberately call for massacres against Israelis, such as those that were characteristic to the Second Intifada. But that's another conversation.

In regards to your question, I highly doubt that the intentions of the Israeli government, in large, are actually to end all attacks on the Gaza strip in exchange for the hostages. Families of hostages, along with thousands of protestors, are literally storming the streets of Israel as we speak, demanding that the government accept the most recent [hostage deal](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/three-phase-ceasefire-deal-hamas-backs-israel-does-not-2024-05-06/) and finally bring their loved ones home.

It's clear that[ politics ](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-weighs-risks-rafah-assault-hostage-dilemma-divides-israelis-2024-05-08/)and Netanyahu's need to appease his nationalist right-wing government are overtaking any actual legitimate move towards freeing the hostages. Many government officials in Israel see the invasion of Rafah as the only means to ""eliminate Hamas"", fully knowing it will endanger the hostages and cause a massacre among the more than a million Gazan civilians sheltering there. The Israeli government cannot claim that it cares about its detained civilians and then uncompromisingly push towards this disastrous invasion, literally against the wishes of its own people.

Was the US invasion of Iraq a genocide?

Is every civil war between two ethnic groups a genocide? 

In most modern conflicts there are lots of civilian deaths so what makes this specific one a genocide and the others not? 

If all these wars are genocide what is the point of even having this word? There was wars before WW2 where massive amounts of civilians were killed. The reason the term genocide was made was to describe the systemic killing of innocent civilians. 

I think itâs clear Israel is doing indiscriminate bombings of Gaza and not being judicial in how they target Hamas terrorists. Too many civilians are dying and itâs a tragedy. 

Itâs also clear theyâre not going out of their way to kill civilians they just accept a high amount of civilian deaths to kill Hamas militants. 


We can say theyâve calculated too high of number of civilians is acceptable to kill one Hamas member. An example would be them bombing a refugee camp to get one Hamas senior leader.

Then with the rise of pan Arab nationalism after the fall of the ottomans combined with a spike in Jewish immigration due to the rise of the NAZIs tensions spiked and sectarian violence was widespread. The Bristish solution was to create 2 states (Palestine and Israel) just as they had with India and Pakistan (we all know how well that turned out). The situation continued to escalate with Palestinians refusing a state (they want it all or they want nothing so they wound up with nothing) and Israel accepting one. We now have the situation today. Modern day historians love to label things with oppressor vs oppressed Marxist narratives to win a moral victory but only achieve enchanced tensions while ignoring nuance. 

None of that excuses Israel's illegal occupation of the west Bank nor its apartheid policies in the west Bank, either the WB is annexed territory and the Palestinians there are due citizenship and rights or its occupied territory and the settlers need to get out. But Israel can't have its cake and eat it too.
 

Also, none of that excuses Arab violence and terrorism against Israeli civilians. Any war should have military targets. A three year old isn't a settler colonialist zionist, they're a 3 year old.

Also, none of that excuses Israeli violence and terrorism against Arab civilians, especially in Gaza. Any war should have military targets. A three year old isn't an extremist Muslim or a Hamas terrorist, they're a 3 year old.

James Baldwin quote: âThe children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognizing this may be incapable of morality.â

So, I may be accused of both sidesing it but what needs to happen is a ceasefire in Gaza and a prosecution of both Israeli and Hamas war crimes or a truth and reconciliation committee where crimes aren't prosecuted but recognized. Then the creation of a free Palestinian state with normalized relations with Israel and the option for full citizenship for Arabs on the Israeli side of the divide and Jews on the Palestinian side. Anyone preventing this solution is an enemy of humanity and prolonging the violence regardless of how anyone labels the history as settler colonialism by Jews or anti immigrant racist violence by Arabs. Neither label matters and both labels are a barrier to peace.",Pro-Israel

Hamas and many of the civilians in Gaza are not innocent. They try to act the victim but they started this and they are persisting with it.

They went further to have access to these tunnels in peoples homes and schools and medical facilities - are the civilians that knew about the access innocent? Not in my book.

The basic (colonial) double standard of the Israel Palestine ""conflict"" is that any Palestinian violence justifies any Israeli violence, but no
Israeli violence ever justifies any Palestinian violence, and once you see it, you'll never stop seeing it.

Under settler colonialism, any kind of resistance is branded as terrorist because the only
acceptable violence is violence by the occupier.
There is always going to be violent resistance against a violent occupation. Make all the judgements or condemnations you like, they
will not matter. It is inevitable. if you don't want the violent resistance, you have to want to see the end of the violent occupation.

""It is utterly impossible to obtain the voluntary consent of the Palestine Arabs for converting Palestine from an Arab country into a country
with Jewish majority. My readers have a general
idea of the history of colonisation in other countries. I suggest that they consider all the precedents with which they are acquainted and see whether there is one solitary instance
of any colonisation being carried on with the consent of the native population. There is no such precedent. The native populations, civilised or uncivilised, have always stubbornly resisted the colonists, irrespective of whether they were civilised or savage.""",Pro-Palestine

**But the average percentage for civilian deaths in urban modern warfare is 90%.**

[https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm](https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm)

U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Charles Brown warned Israel that prolonging the war in Gaza will drive more civilians to terrorism (Jacob Magid, âNew top American general says Israeli goal of toppling Hamas âa pretty large order,ââ Times of Israel, November 10, 2023).

Sadly, civilians are âcollateral damageâ in wars. Neither Israel nor any other army can base its operations on how they will react. The Allies did not concern themselves with whether more German civilians would be motivated to become Nazis after the firebombing of Dresden. The war on terror waged by the United States since 9/11 has resulted in many civilian casualties. Still, war planners have not been deterred by the possibility that more people will join ISIS or al-Qaeda. President Barack Obama didnât halt drone strikes against terrorists because hundreds of civilians were mistakenly killed.

Israel takes measures no other army does to protect civilians while Hamas uses them as shields. For most of the world, it is a tragedy that thousands have died (the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry figures cannot be trusted as they do not identify Hamas terrorists among the casualties and exaggerate fatalities). However, Hamas uses people as cannon fodder and their deaths as propaganda instruments. Gaza families should blame the terrorists who built tunnels for themselves instead of shelters, but some may seek revenge against Israel. Does that mean Israel shouldnât destroy Hamas to protect its citizens?

Brown and many other Western officials donât acknowledge that Israel is part of the Middle East, not the Middle West. Israelis know Hamas is just one enemy. Iran and its proxies want to kill Jews and will not be satisfied until Israel is destroyed. That will be true no matter how many Gazans die.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others think the âmoderateâ Palestinians in the West Bank have a different agenda because they refuse to believe that Palestinians mean what they say and teach. When they chant, âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine must be free,â it is a call for genocide. When their textbook maps show all of Israel as Palestine, they want their children to believe Israel does not and should not exist. When Mahmoud Abbas calls on Palestinians to defend the al-Aqsa Mosque against fictitious Jewish raiders, he is perpetuating the Islamist lie that it is in danger. When Blinken naively talks about a two-state solution, he ignores the Palestiniansâ repeated rejection of the idea before a single Gazan died.

The Palestinians trace their grievance to the 1917 Balfour Declaration and engaged in terrorism for three decades before the partition resolution. They consider the establishment of a Jewish state in 1948 the Nakba (âcatastropheâ), not the capture of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967. Palestinian fedayeen began attacking Israel from Gaza in the 1950s when Egypt occupied it. The PLO was created in 1964, three years before the Israeli âoccupationâ of the disputed territories. Hamas began bombarding Israel with rockets after every Israeli left Gaza, squandering the opportunity to build the infrastructure for a state.

Hamas must be eliminated as a threat. Whether more Palestinians decide to become terrorists is out of Israelâs control. They will be a danger for Israel but would only compound the tragedy for the Palestinians by ensuring no Israeli government will agree to another Hamastan on its border.",Pro-Israel

From the Author:

&gt; Over 50+ DMs in a day saying that if I went on the ground to serve Gazan Palestinians that theyâd unalive me. Along with other horrible physical acts. So, I assembled a team of local lgbtq+ people and allies on the ground in Egypt and went far and wide to deliver direct cash + physical aid to Gazan Palestinians in need as requested.
&gt; 
&gt; Did I die? No. Did any of our team mates die? No. Were there LGBTQ+ Gazan Palestinians who were living at an adult age? Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; Not only did I survive but I was welcomed into homes, given food and drinks despite tight resources. Allowed to use the restroom of my choice. Allowed to work directly with the Palestinian Embassy as the sole cash aid provider to families on the ground and our team members were provided body guards and bullet proof escorts to more dangerous locations. The journalist syndicate also opened their doors taking us from home to home- and every single time I was open off the bat that I am lgbtq+. Not something I typically do, but for this I did. I was accepted in rooms of all men. I was accepted into spaces of all women. I was held and allowed to hold others. And so were my teammates.
&gt; 
&gt; Hundreds of families personally visited in 3 weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; Is the situation as horrific as You have seen on tv? Itâs worse. We visited hospitals filled with air strike survivors. Studio apartment with 15 refugees stack in a single space having lost their life back home. We walked through rubble and ruins and saw the devastating impacts of war.
&gt; 
&gt; This propaganda that LGBTQ+ people must not call for humanitarian aid or rights for Palestinian people simply because of conservative values is unethical and wrong. Every human- EVERY HUMAN deserves the right to food shelter water physical safety and freedom of movement. And I mean EVERY. So donât get it twisted.
&gt; 
&gt; #lovewins #thetruth #myth #storytime #lgbtq
&gt; Ps Our cash aid mission is still continuing. Want to support and get Your name on an envelope? Donate to the link in my bio. Our efforts are Palestinian run @roaakashef and ally managed @arielleabroad PPS probably ended my career by posting this according to some other folx in my life so- thatâs that. Itâs been a good ride.
&gt; 

Other comments from the author

&gt; Ok for people saying I was treated differently because we were giving money: actually this is untrue. The people we visited never EVER not once knew we were delivering cash aid. Ever. They thought were were there to charge devices, witness their stories, or sometimes just to refill water bottles. We only have cash aid when we were walking out the door to leave.
&gt; 
&gt; Why? Well our goal was to assess community need as well as understand the scope of need. We couldnât do that with cash up front because it alters peopleâs storytelling.
&gt; 
&gt; I have over 30 witnesses on the ground who can attest that this was the method- as well as vouch for the fact that cases do not know they are recieving any type of aid upon arrival.

&gt; Okey Iâm seeing a lot of âBut what about Israel?â Yeah- what about it? No one is in my inbox slandering itâs people as homophobes who need to die as a result. So thereâs no âmyth to bustâ. And on top of that I DID already assess my usefulness to families affected by October 7th. I raised thousands of dollars for affected families and asked the questions I ask any time I consider offering on the ground assistance. Do they need food? No they didnât. Do they need water? No they didnât. Do they need shelter? Pretty much all had it and the others put up in nice hotels or with family. Do they need freedom of movement? No they have it. Do they need physical safety? Yes against air strikes or antisemitism- so I condemned air strikes and antisemitism.
&gt; 
&gt; Now when I assessed my usefulness on the ground for Gaza, Palestine I asked these same questions. And- the answer to every single question? Yes these things were needed to be acquired still. On a mass level.
&gt; 
&gt; And thatâs all. Itâs not personal. Itâs just science- food, shelter, water, physical safety and freedom of movement. I fight for these things. And I condemn murder by anyone anywhere as well as the detainment of any people against their will anywhere. Itâs simple.

-

&gt; For clarity: our team operated within Gaza, Palestine - at the Rafah border crossing, Arish, Egypt, Cairo and several other places in between. The people we saw within Egypt when there were ALL evacuees from after October 7th as well as people stranded because of October 7th. Yes I had special permissions to go to some of the more restricted areas as we worked with the Palestinian Embassy, local Arish officer, and others. But our local Egyptian and Palestinian team members got to do the the most because they had more free unlimited access.
&gt; 
&gt; And yes people have been allowed in and out of Gaza, Palestine including a couple thousand medical evacuees, journalists, aid workers and more.

Second. Earlier this year the west bank had multiple reports of *""The IDF is killing children""*. And then it turned out that the vast majority of those children were 16-17 year olds with rifles shooting at the IDF (*no one cared, they only cared about the age of those combatants)*. Not to mention that it's easy to call civilian deaths when all the armed militants are wearing t-shirts and jeans.

And how the campaign is conducted. It is perfectly fine to ask civilians to evacuate an area before a major combat operation. Many Gazans have evacuated, and unlike what you said, the evidence of people who are trying to evacuate getting bombed and shot have been by Hamas terrorists. There is plenty of footage of them setting up roadblocks and shooting/bombing Gazans trying to flee. So how in the hell is?: ""*Human shield argument is so so so false"".* It's the literal definition of using human shields.

Literally every war fought in urban areas has a horrific amount of civilian casualties, even when fighting with maximum amount of restraint. There is no law of war that says you aren't allowed to fight combatants who are fighting out of a densely populated area. The double standards when it comes to Israel are insane. There is no law that says that the IDF has to warn or roof knock before they drop a bomb into a building. Yet they do it. They gave civilians 2-3 weeks to leave and are warning before dropping bombs. That's way more than what you are legally required to do before conducting strikes. If civilians chose to stay or Hamas stopped them from leaving, that's not Israel's fault.

How does Israel have any other option here? Why were France and the US allowed to bomb ISIS even though they were located in densely populated areas? Why was it OK for the allies to bomb Germany even though they were fighting out of densely populated areas? With that kind of logic human shields make you fully immune to any response and you can run ISIS out of Raqqa or Mosul and there is nothing anyone is allowed to do. This is hypocrisy 101.

Genocide. Genocide is the deliberate targeting of an unarmed group with the intention of killing all or most of them. Since the Pals are armed and fighting back and have the chance to surrender this is war and clearly, not the case. But lets give you the benefit of the doubt. Let's argue that the Pals are not armed and this is not war.

There are about 2 million people in Gaza. So far the Israelis have killed about 20,000, most of them Hamas terrorists. (The Hamas ministry of health numbers are clearly fake as evidenced by their own incredible inconsistencies). This has taken about 5 months so far. So if we assume that the Pals are a distinct people (which they are not - they are just mostly fanatical Moslem Arabs, a part of the 300 million Arabs) it would take about 100 x 5 months to kill them all or to commit an actual genocide. That is 500 months or about over 42 years at the current rate. Lets assume that killing only half would be a genocide. That would take 21 years.

555,12/1/2023 20:00,"A summary, will try to keep it short. 

In the Middle Ages jews were hated for some reason in Europe. European kings saw this and offered them impopulair jobs like tax officer and loan provider with high rents, to make use of the situation, which fueled the hatred even more. Antisemitism was born. This would eventually lead to the holocaust. A jewish guy named Theodor Herzl came up with an idea: there must be a own state of jews where only jews live. Zionism was born. Herzl started lobbying rich jew families and British aristocrats for this idea. The Brits thought this to be a good idea. British politician Belfour wrote this down in the form of a declaration. Although sceptical at the beginning, after the holocaust, many jews embraced the idea. So the jews moved to Palestine little by little and settled there. 

At first this wasnât a problem for the Arabs living there, since the jews werenât talking about this idea of a jewish state. And the arabs were actually used to living alongside jews. There were already jews living in Palestine way before the world wars. They had nothingto do with zionism. After a while this idea of a jewish state started popping up more and more. This caused small conflicts and fights about land. At this points the jews started establishing terrorist organisations like the Stern and Irgun. They were extreme violent nog only against Palestinians but also British, since the Brits were running the place at the time. 

Fast forward to 1947, the violence on both sides were increasing and the tension rised to its peak. A war started between zionists and surrounding arab countries who were fed up with the zionist troublemakers. The arabs lost the war, there were like 80k zionist terrorists against 40k arab soldiers at this point. This event led to the displacement of roughly a million Palestinians to other countries, the west bank and of course, gaza. 

The international community saw where this was going and sent a Swedish diplomat, Folke Bernadotte, to look for a solution. However zionist terrorists were not happy with the situation and murdered him and a assistant.

These events lead to radicalism on the Palestinian side and ever since, the fight is going on.",Neutral

So my understanding - and I'm open to being corrected on this - is  that it's completely legal for an ambulance to evacuate an injured Hamas member. That's not a war crime. And it's prohibited under international law to target such an ambulance. 

If the ambulance is being used for acts harmful to the enemy outside of its humanitarian duties, then it can be targeted, but even then only under strict conditions.

Transporting weapons to and from the battlefield makes the ambulance a valid target, but simply evacuating an injured combatant does not.

&gt;Why is no one demanding that maybe Hamas comes out of Rafah and fight like men and leave innocents in Rafah out of it completely.

&gt;Hamas deserves blame for using innocent palestinians as human shields  
  
Why is no one telling Hamas to fight in military uniforms instead of fighting in civillian clothes? That is a war crime as old as war itself.

Of course I agree with all of this but it doesn't give Israel cart blache to target anything they want to.

But I think because it was mainly to get the hostages out and rid Hamas, its more of tragically the consequences of all forms of all war in invasion which is why War doesn't solve anything.

The mass death attributes to a mix of Israel's tendency to violently attack back, and failure to protect and get the Palestinians in the crossfire to get to safe areas. Some countries wouldn't let them in or they didn't have the means to get there in time, they didn't have bomb shelters, eventually they crowded into camps where it was more likely for mass casualties. Yes there have been ""warnings"" but at this point like for example when they got to Rafah, they sent leaflets to evacuate but where were they supposed to go....everywhere around them has been destroyed.

559,11/30/2023 22:19,"Iâm saying thatâs an absurd analogy. Rafah is a refugee camp that due to the destruction elsewhere in Gaza, is one of the only habitable areas left and civilians were moved there following advice from the IDF. There is now nowhere for many of them to go. The analogy would only make sense if the IDF pushed them and was driving the car, because the civilians were forced to shelter here and are hit by IDF weapons.

Israel are fighting an insurgency not a conventional war, yet are using conventional war tactics, by the very definition of an insurgency itâs a war where the enemy is using guerrilla tactics from an enemy embedded within the native population. This is the war theyâve escalated by invading Rafah. Itâs an insurgency because Hamas and Gaza are already defeated in any traditional sense before the war started. They have no standing army, no control of their borders or modern military equipment.

Thereâs not a case in modern history of an insurgency being defeated using the tactics Israel are using and Israel bare responsibility for continuing on using these tactics, tactics that results in high civilian casualties, like bombing an Hamas target regardless of the civilians around.

The tactics fail because by killing that many civilians youâve just created hundreds more recruits for Hamas to replace the targets. It makes the war aim âdestroy Hamasâ impossible and everyone knows this at this point.

Again your deferring responsibility, Iâm more than happy to discuss Egypts actions throughout the war and the morality of weather they should open the border or not, but their lack of action on the border doesnât mean Israel defers responsibility to them for the war Israel is carrying out.

This is such a disingenuous claim on President Herzogâs part. Israel just last week opened two more check points for aid trucks, but only regularly keeps open only one entrance to Gaza (Rafah, in collaboration with Egypt. That crossing, in the sparsely populated Sinai, is served by only one airport and one road, leading to long traffic jams and bottlenecks in distribution. With a ratio of three checking stations to one barely adequate border crossing, massive delays on already checked trucks are inevitable, and thatâs without mentioning that the checking stations are in Israel, so trucks must drive down into Egypt and then back up to Gaza to get to their destination. 

Some other method besides just Rafah needs to be opened up soon to prevent disease and starvation among an estimated 1.5 million displaced Gazans now living in the South.

Explaining all this to you would be long and cumbersome but I will try to give you my view, in generally. It's important not to listen to internet propagandists. If you ask me, I don't think you should get into it as you don't get into most of the conflicts in countries far away from you.


It's just important for me to emphasize few things as an Israeli. Israel does'nt commit genocide. We are in a constant war of existence against a terrorist organization that controls 2 million peoplein Gaza. I'm not throwing out Israel's opinions about Hamas being a terrorist organization. Many democratic countries define it that way. This organization is responsible for all the administrative institutions of Gaza. Among other things, about the educational institutions. They brainwash the Palestinians into hating Jews. We know that it doesn't work for everyone, but it's clear that there are a lot of brainwashed people and there are also some people who just want to live in peace. At least the initial vision of Hamas is to take over the State of Israel.
Israel is'nt committing genocide. Hamas uses its citizens as human shields. The number of people who were killed is'nt cannot be estimated. Many Institute who rely on Hamas sources like media outlets that are considered ""reliable"". The UN recently published it's assessment - I don't know what it is based on. Israelis (and I belive that many leaders secretly) think the UN isn't objective in everything related to the war and at all. I won't go into it, but just take for example the fact that the chair of UN Human Rights Council Social Forum is Iran (the greatest enemy of Israel and one of the greatest enemies of the Western world who violates the human rights of a citizen on a daily basis).


As women who live in Israel I lost trust in governments, the media, UN and etc a long time ago. Our world is driven by interests. If it is a news company which one of the it's investors own of a large corporation, so the channel won't criticize the company negatively (I have exemple which happened in my country); another exemple: Or members of parliament who take care of lobbyists before the public... In generally, think about what I'm saying here: we do'nt fully live in democracies countries as we are told. There are those who take advantage of the weaknesses of democratic regimes and harm them (connected what I told you about the Un and politicians).Â 
I understand why a lot of people in the West would disagree with me and specifically in Canada, because the life in Canada are very peaceful (as much as I know),Â 
but think about it for a second.


Back to things you here in the media:
Even when I would see positive reviews of Israel on other issues, they were inaccurate. Look at reports about Canada and tell me yourself how well journalists know your country.
Of course, there are articles that don't objectively cover certain topics so that you believe in the world view of the journalist.
So I give you important tip for life: read information from several sources with different interests.
I'm saying all of this because if you wanna know more about the war, you need to know how to access the information in a smarter way. Who against whom (a large part of the countries of the Arab world against Israel). To take into account the proximity of the country to the war - for example, the USA is very involved in it. To refer to sources also according to if ther worte by right or left reporter and according to the country on whose behalf the reporter is, the degree of freedom of the press there and whether it is democratic and to what extent.


Regarding the press: in war there is also war propaganda. Iran - which is always behind the scenes (in wars against Israel) and Hamas is good at propaganda. At least at the beginning of the war (and possibly even now) they had many videos of ""corpses"". In many pictures you can see that it is a doll or a man who wrapped himself in a bag. There is a famous photo of Gazati in a bag using the cell phone (probably caught between photos of him pretending to be a corpse). There are some rumors that I guess that pro Israelis published but refuted from what that I know.




If you ask me and many other people here, then the extreme pro-Palestinians you see on the streets are divided into 2 groups:
1. A herd of people who do not understand what they are protesting for.
2. Extremist people who want to wipe out the State of Israel and persuade others to shout ""Intifada"" in the street so that those who understand what I mean (like me) will be afraid to oblige and in order to persuade the West to legitimize actions that harm Israel as a first step and as a subsequent step in the Western world itself.
It sounds like I'm throwing things into the air, but despite the crazy political pressure that's being put on Biden, he's still helping Israel in the war effort financially because it's important to him to take care of its existence. Israel supports the US from a security point of view in an insane way. For example, technological developments such as ""Iron Dome"" and intelligence cooperation that helps protect American citizens.




This forum is relatively balanced. I can tell you that much of the information sent here is reliable. There are many inaccuracies on behalf of people who live abroad who do not fully understand the situation. Whether they support Israel or Gaza. There are a few extremists here and there, but you will understand very quickly who is against who. Most of the time they show nerves or base themselves on Untrustworthy garbage.


I want to emphasize:
As an Israeli, the safety of the Gazans held by Hamas is important to me. I want peace and hope for it. I doubt it will happen in my lifetime. There is no Palestinian state and I don't think there is maturity for a two-state solution. I don't like my prime minister- BiBi. I don't know what he is up to but I know that I know that senior security officials of Israel and Biden don't really like it. Since the beginning of the war, they have been trying to pressure him to decide who will rule Gaza on the day after. If he had done it at the beginning of the war then everything would have been different. Soldiers returned to the areas they left and which Hamas took control of them after the IDF (army) left. From the media I guees this happened probably for this reason. Of course, as part of this inefficiency, they die for nothing. I understood that the Americans estimate that 65% of the Hamas terrorists and 65% of the tunnels they built in Gaza are still exist. I still expect my country to destroy at least most of these tunnels. From what I understanding, Biden trusts the Minister of Defense and the senior security officials and does'nt trust Bibi who plays political games to keep himself in power. I think that Bidan is a little affected by the pressure exerted on him by public opinion and is fear from the results of the elections, therefore his support for Israel is expressed in a crooked way and everything comes out very strange.

&gt;At least three months prior to the attack, surveillance soldiers serving on a base in Nahal Oz reported signs that something unusual was underway at the already-tumultuous Gaza border, situated a kilometer from them.

&gt;The activity reported by the soldiers included information onÂ HamasÂ operatives conducting training sessions multiple times a day, digging holes and placing explosives along the border. According to the accounts of the soldiers, no action was taken by those who received the reports.

&gt;""Itâs infuriating,â she told Kan of the intelligence failure. âWe saw what was happening, we told them about it, and we were the ones who were murdered.â

&gt;The Hamas terrorists would train at the border fence nonstop, Desiatnik told Kan. At first, it was once a week, then once a day, and then nearly constantly.

&gt;In addition to passing on information about the frequency of the training going on at the fence, the surveillance soldier said she collected evidence of the content of the training, which included how to drive a tank and how to cross into Israel via a tunnel. As the activity on the border increased, she realized that âit was just a matter of timeâ until something happened.

&gt;We sat on shifts and saw the convoy of vans. We saw the training, people shooting and rolling, practicing taking over a tank. The training went from once a week to twice a week, from every day to several times a day,â she told Channel 12.

Last weekend, 100,000 people took to the streets of the capital demanding an end to the bombing in Gaza, and police expect similar numbers again.

Rallies are expected in many UK cities, including Manchester and Glasgow.

The demos come as Israel expands its strikes, three weeks after Hamas launched an attack on its territory.

On Saturday afternoon, crowds started to gather near the Golden Jubilee Bridge holding signs saying ""Gaza, stop the massacre"" and ""Free Palestine, end Israeli occupation"".

A sound system led people to chant ""Stop arming Israel. Stop bombing Gaza"", ""We are all Palestinian"" along with a slogan saying ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""

London demonstration Police warned people to expect large crowds in the Westminster area next to the River Thames Home Secretary Suella Braverman had previously urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the ""river to the sea"" chant as an ""expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world"".

Large crowds are expected to gather around the Embankment, Whitehall, Strand, Westminster and Waterloo Bridge, the Metropolitan Police said.

The force said more than 1,000 officers have been deployed.

Elsewhere in the UK, thousands attended a pro-Palestinian rally outside Manchester's Central Library at St Peter's Square.

In response to the massive retaliation he's gotten both internationally and internally, he (along with the US) proposed a 6 week pause in exchange for all hostages being released. The US is trying to spin it like the 6 week pause would be negotiated into a longer and perhaps lasting ceasefire, but Netanyahu has repeatedly said that nothing and no one will stop him from invading Rafah and fully resuming after those 6 weeks.

The official said the US believes that an unguided munition dropped via dive-bombing is similarly precise to a guided munition. 

and

&gt; âThe IDF strikes military targets of the Hamas terrorist organization, based on high-quality intelligence and the operational necessity, while using high-quality munitions that are operated by skilled pilots and advanced systems, which continuously assess and verify that the strikes are directed at military targets. The type of munitions used in each strike is determined according to the characteristics of the target, the operational need, and the effort to mitigate harm to civilians, which the terrorist organization uses as a human shields,â Dinar said. 

So the IDF is using unguided munitions, in conjunction with dive bombing, if there is little civilian risk. if there is higher risk then they use guided munitions. So what the fuck are these people complaining about?

611,11/20/2023 8:42,"Gaza faces unprecedented humanitarian crises due to relentless military operations by Israel. Over 1.7 million displaced people are sheltering in makeshift facilities, with critical shortages of food, water, and medical supplies. The blockade has turned Gaza into an open-air prison, where civilians endure daily bombings, loss of homes, and destruction of essential infrastructure. The West Bank suffers under oppressive military occupation that severely restricts Palestinian movement through numerous checkpoints and barriers. The illegal expansion of Israeli settlements continues unabated, systematically taking over Palestinian land and resources, making any viable Palestinian statehood nearly impossible.

The recent military actions, especially in areas like Rafah, have led to massive forced displacements, with thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes. These actions align with a broader strategy of ethnic cleansing, aiming to reduce the Palestinian presence and solidify Israeli control over the entire region. To date, more than 5 million Palestinians live in the diaspora, scattered across the Middle East and beyond, often in refugee camps with limited rights and resources. Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories face systemic discrimination reminiscent of apartheid. Different laws and rights for Jewish and Palestinian residents create a system of inequality that permeates every aspect of life, from housing to education and healthcare.

The Nakba, or ""catastrophe,"" of 1948 saw the forced expulsion of around 750,000 Palestinians from their homes during the creation of the state of Israel. This event is crucial to understanding the roots of the current conflict and the ongoing displacement and dispossession of Palestinians. The Nakba is not just a historical event but a continuing process of ethnic cleansing, evidenced by current Israeli policies and military actions. Numerous international bodies, including the United Nations, have condemned Israelâs actions as violations of international law and human rights. Israel has violated more than 70 UN resolutions, which include demands for withdrawal from occupied territories, cessation of settlement activities, and respect for Palestinian human rights.

The suffering of Mizrahi Jews expelled from Arab countries is a tragic chapter, but it does not justify the ongoing occupation and systemic oppression of Palestinians. Moreover, Mizrahi Jews themselves have faced significant discrimination within Israeli society, highlighting the internal complexities of the state. Recently, Jordan has been revoking the citizenship of Palestinians, particularly targeting officials from the PA and PLO, to prevent any notion of Jordan becoming an alternative homeland for Palestinians. This leaves many Palestinians stateless and exacerbates their precarious situation.

The need for historical context is essential, but itâs equally important to acknowledge and address the current injustices and humanitarian crises. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not just a historical debate; it is a present-day humanitarian disaster that demands urgent attention and action. Recognizing the reality on the ground and the lived experiences of Palestinians is critical to any meaningful discussion about peace and justice in the region.",Pro-Palestine

Yes, Israel continued with security measures, as without them at that time there would likely be tons of terror attacks on Israel, as were before the disengagement. Ideologies don't simply go away in a day. What Israel thought, and this is documented both in testimonies, and in public speeches is that after the disengagement the Palestinians would stop or decrease the terror ideologies, and then Israel could lift the security measures. It unfortunately didn't happen. I would add in order not to mislead anyone - Israel's PM at that time was aware that this might not work, and that it could go either way, just that he thought in both cases it's for the better of Israel not to have the settlers around. 

The second claim - Kind of feels like cherry picking and ignoring timelines. If you actually read about why this person said those things - in the 80s Hamas was perceived as the more pragmatic out of the Palestinian Factions, and the one that Israel could actually negotiate a settlement with. Yes, secular terrorism exists as well, and at that time, the non-Hamas terrorists were scarier. Was Israel wrong? maybe, we don't have access to the counterfactual, it could also be the case where things would go far worse. 

Moreover, I have no idea why do you pick the easy cases. For instance, a clear policy that Israel does in order to improve the Palestinian economy is taking in Palestinians workers. notice that Israel could get better and cheaper labor from many other countries, as it does in areas further away from the Palestinian territories, but it doesn't. Why?

Itâs worth noting that everything prior to October 7th was NOT featured much in the media such as the Hezbollah attacks but also Israeli military plans such as Operation Pillar of Defense, Operation Cast Lead and Operation Protective Edge. You repeat that Israeli Jews are facing antisemitism and this is a point which has been discussed through and through. We know antisemitism and Islamophobia has been in the rise. 10% of Israeli Jews in the Israel Democracy Institute poll said they would support a pause in fighting in order to exchange hostages - referring to how Israelâs main aim is not to return hostages. 57.5% of Israeli Jews said that they believed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were using too little firepower in Gaza - more than half of Israelis want more destruction in Gaza.  Many of the population does support whatâs going on in Gaza and itâs important to remember this. You say Israel is being condemned as a whole - it is - but so is Palestine as it is regarded that everyone is Palestine is either Hamas, a terrorist, jihad or growing up to be on of them. Iâve said many times - it works both ways. I hardly believe Israel âdefendingâ itself constitutes to 30,000+ deaths and Gaza being bombed to the ground. More bombs dropped on Gaza in less than a year than in the whole of WW2. 

Israel claimed that the Rafah massacre was a âtragedy of hindsightâ but saying âwhoopsâ after forcing millions of people into a âsafe zoneâ and then bombing it doesnât quite cut it. There are almost too many lies, distortions and falsehoods to keep track of said by the Israeli government. Forty babies beheaded by Hamas? Never happened. Babies baked in ovens or hung on clothes lines? False. A Bond-villain-style lair hidden under al-Shifa hospital? Nope. Palestinians in Gaza caught on camera faking their injuries? A complete fabrication. The list of Hamas hostage-takers found on a wall in the al-Rantisi childrenâs hospital? Sorry, no, it was just the days of the week on a calendar in Arabic.

Israel has ALL the advantage in the conflict. They donât allow any international news to report unbiased and theyâre allowed to kill aid workers with NO repercussions.

Tell me.

The Pro-Israeli side are experts in whataboutism yet fail to see the hypocrisy and double standards.

When a Hamas terrorist films themselves committing a war crime, ""it's a heinous atrocity they bragged about openly""

When a IDF soldier commits a war crime and uploads it onto Tik Tok, it's ""individual soldiers blowing off steam"" or ""individual soldiers not following the rules of engagement""

When some Hamas lunatic claims they want to keep attacking Israel to do more Oct 7, it's evidence of Hamas genocidal plans

When some Israeli Minister claims they should ""nuke"" Gaza, or deprive them of all food, water etc., it's ""a fringe figure who is not involved in official government policy""

So much double standards.

It's just Hasbara nonsense. This is the Israeli logic:

Step 1: ""Warn civilians to get out of the area""

Step 2: ""Bomb the area""

Step 3: Blame deaths of Civilians on Hamas using them as human shields

Step 4: Claim lots of Hamas terrorists killed

Prior to the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the British promised the Arab population that if they helped thd British during WW1, the British would help them to establish an independent state. As we all know now, this DID happen for Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The Palestinians were left out due to the fact thst the Zionists had their Greedy eyes on Palestine as a prospective ""Home for the Jewish People"", despite the fact that there were VERY FEW Jewish people living in Palestine, and that the overwhelming majority of the Palistinian population were Arab Muslims. 
Between then and now the Jewish population increased primarily due to targeted immigration encouraged by Zionists of European Jews not indigenous to Palestine. 
There was even a partnership between the Zionists and the Nazis to expedite this, as both got what they wanted - removal of Jews from Europe.
Thus, virtually NONE of today's Jews in Israel, the area known as Palestine untill 1948 are indigenous to the area, but are descendents of people from Europe who migrated to Palestine after 1917, or in many cases are European themselves! For proof see photo of the Israeli Olympic Team at Paris 2024. 
The Palestinians are however indigenous to the area, and the people of Gaza in particular are a casualty of the events of 1947/48, as their parents/ grandparents were the people dispossessed by the Zionist Terrorists ( which eventually reformed as the IDF) who forcibly removed them from their homes in order to settle Zionist Jews on it.

It was.  Well.  Unprovoked that is.  Of course israel says that it was provoked...  But...  well, that's that, right?  Well...  as it turns out, the critical thinker might look just a tiny bit deeper into things...

Israel started closing border crossings between Gaza and israel, Gazas only reasonable export market, on israeli claims of provocation...  from the West Bank...  The israeli governments ""rationale"" for the earliest border closings in the first few months were literally collective punishment.

They did it because they could, just to literally punish innocent people.  Because what?  Is somebody suddenly going to start enforcing international law on the nation founded by foreign terrorists, israel, founded by the irgun, by lehi, and the terrorist haganah?

The way I understand it, pro Israel people here are telling all the time, that Hamas is beyond evil. The worst thing ever. So every tunnel Hamas builds, is not just a tunnel, but a terror tunnel. Every closeness to civilians in one of the densest settled areas on this planet a proof of their evil human shield strategy and so on. And this of course justifies, that Jews worldwide can only be saved by flatening Gaza and making millions Palestinians homeless refugees or that killing a dozen civilians for killing one terrorist might be a reasonable strategy in an area with almost half the population being minors.

And now you say, that Israel is thriving despite the terror, no country could or should accept? While Palestinians suffer like hell and now even worse, under a pressure, that is even higher, than the ones Israelians have to endure? So why shouldn't some Palestians think, that Hamas might be their chance, to fight pressure with pressure? That every suffering of Israelians is tolerable, compared to their own suffering? 


I don't want to justify Hamas terror and I'm very sure you don't want that too. But without the intention of comparing terror and war victims, I see the extreme suffering and trauma on both sides and I have difficulties to see Hamas as the only problem, that keeps the region in this awful situation. 

Did you know, that 2023 was the bloodiest year for Palestinians in the Westbanks, even before October. Why? Why do Palestinians have to leave the fields and villages, to increase the safety of illegal settlements, protected by one of the most effective militaries in the region (which was leaving the Gaza border less protected)? And the Biden government, being far from being antisemitic, tries to remind the IDF in an increasing loud voice, to do more for protecting civilians. Why?

Israel has all the right to live in peace and to fight terror. But it doesn't have the right, do do this without limits. And somehow Israel has more and more difficulties, to convince at least it's closest allies, that it has a good strategy, that might justify all the collateral damage it cocreates.

752,7/6/2024 14:39,"First off, I agree with your overall opinion that the binary mentality on this topic is insanely frustrating when having discussions about this conflict.

Collective Punishment: The reason why there's pushback against this opinion is because you need to prove that Israel is trying to punish the people of Gaza. Right now, with recent death statistics provided from both the Hamas and Israel side (assuming they're accurate), the combatant: civilian death ratio is well below the average for warfare on the Palestinian side, showing that Israel is most likely attempting to target Hamas. You've probably heard this many times, but civilian casualties are a byproduct of war. You need to prove that Israel is intending to kill as many Palestinians as possible for this point to work, which is hard to say at this current stage.

Hamas vs Palestine: I agree with you that both Hamas and the current Israel government aren't amazing. Right now, Israel's stated goal is to get rid of Hamas completely, and I agree with that. There will most likely never be peace with Hamas in power of Gaza. Unsure of what will happen after that, but my guess is that they will occupy the territory for some time to weed out more extremist groups and maybe try to stabilize the economy and area. Yes, children in Gaza will be radicalized, but they already have been and are becoming radicalized in that region. The only way to stop that would be through proper education, which is a step for the future. I don't think that Israel cares much about the hostages anymore, or even thinks that they're still alive at this point.

The dispute of the land: Yes, you're right, it's the British's fault. But there's been countless wars and conflicts between Jews and Arabs of the region for the land, with the Jews ""winning"" most of them. That's why they have it today, and in my opinion, that's fair: that's how humans determine who's land is who's. You also need to understand that this is deeper than just land, it's also in small parts about values/ideas of justice, and religion.

Grace: Yes, the weaponization of misinformation today, especially on this conflict, has been very annoying. I have to disagree on the college protest parts though. I don't believe the majority are protesting their uni's connection to Israel. Maybe that was the original goal, but it has definitely spiraled into a Pro-Palestine/Anti-Israel protest. You can tell by the chants, why would the students be chanting ""from the river to the sea Palestine will be free""? (antisemitic chant imo but pretty sure most Americans don't know what its origins are, so probably just ignorance from protesters)

It is a high bar.
Aid is coming in to Gaza, they need more of it, but Israel isnât blowing up all the food trucks coming through Rafah.

For example many of the freelance reporters that were killed support Hamas and participated in the Oct 7th attacks so rightly deserve to face consequences for their actions which unfortunately can be death.  


Their families don't deserve to, but since they shelter them its an acceptable sacrifice that will go a long way to promote peace in the region.

It would be great if they can be captured, but they are welcome to go to rafah and camp out there or surrender to the IDF.

English is my third language, so forgive me. But what does the quoted mean?

&gt;In last weekâs order, the court ruled by 13 votes to two that Israel should: âImmediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.â

&gt;I'm a bit of Law junkie myself and I see ton of misuse of international law especially when conducted in warfare.  
When people start misusing law quotation to discredit the mere existence of Israel or justify anyone shouting ""This is genocide this is genocide"" then I can only stay puzzled by the degenerocity of deeper lawful aspects such as conduction of War.

&gt;War isn't illegal, it's unpleasent, undesired, but to conduct war is perfectly legal.  
Especially in the case of retaliation against Hamas and other terror organizations that acting like de-facto governance or deep-state governance in case of Hezbollah.

I don't disagree with any of this. I'm also not convinced there is a reason to worry about countries like SA weaponizing the international court. Israel has ignored the ICJ as far as I can understand it and the genocide claims will be found to be baseless. What exactly did SA achieve?

&gt;This misuse is pity and undesired as it only ties our hand to fight against Terror and I personally believe these conducts and laws will change to accomodate fighting against any kind of terrorism.  
Until then Geneva conventions and other misuses of international law will be used as weapons against fighting Radical Islam.

I understand the point you're trying to make but I'm not there. I will have to educate myself more on this subject I guess.

However, please try to refrain from making any comments questioning the integrity of Col. Waibhav Kaleâs moral character. He was a 22-year Indian Army veteran, he was an infantryman throughout his career and was at the forefront of handling terrorism in the J&amp;K sector. He also had field experience working with the UN in Congo. Do you really think that a man of such courage of conviction would go to Gaza and work hand in gloves with Hamas terrorists?

Indians have a long history of being at the frontlines of conflict and working as peacekeepers. We are one of the largest contributors to the UN Peacekeeping Forces. Please do not use the examples of a few to defame the sanctity of the work done by the UN, as well as the many who have laid down their lives doing the same.

Yes, I have seen the drone footage of UN personnel and UN-marked vehicles in close proximity to members of Hamas, but what exactly does that prove? The UN has already said it evacuated the warehouse where the footage was captured, and we all know that there is a power vacuum in Gaza. What about the possibility that the warehouse was taken over by Hamas and the UN staff was trying to make them leave from there?

Everyone in Gaza knows that the Israeli military constantly surveils them, and I'm sure even terrorists would not be so foolish as to openly talk with UN staff if they were colluding with the UN in the way it has been portrayed. I'm not disregarding the footage, but there are both grey and white areas. Just because a UN staff member or car was in close proximity to a terrorist DOES NOT warrant Israel to openly use tank fire on a UN vehicle or its personnel!

[This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/13/un-worker-killed-rafah-israel-gaza/)Â clearly shows the vehicle used and the impact of the shot that was fired. From the looks of it, it appears deliberate and not simply a case of the vehicle being caught in crossfire.

I'm not here to debate anyone; what happened has already happened. We believe that Col. Kale sacrificed his life for the peace of Israel and Palestine. We hope that Col. Kale's supreme sacrifice will not be in vain and that, on his last journey, the cause he stood up forâa just and peaceful causeâwill not be forsaken.

Hell, you don't even have to be an Islamic extremist. 99% of gangbangers arrested on the streets in the U.S. claim ""police brutality"". Do you think they're all victims of it?

They dropped the PLO like a hot potato once they stopped blowing up tuff and tried to embrace peaceful solutions.

Even a really stupid person can see by watching the video's Hamas uploaded from Oct 7th and watching Palestinians celebrating in the streets when Hamas terrorist drug the mutilated, murdered bodies of Israelis around on their little victory tour that there is zero chance of any kind of solution that doesn't involve killing all the Jews. 

A Palestinian organization even took a survey after Oct 7th, when everyone was 100% clear the horrible things Hamas terrorists did on Oct 17th and right at 80% (dislocated from Gaza and ones in the West Bank states they agreed with what took place on the 7th. It's pretty clear that Palestinians in Gaza to a large extent ARE Hamas.

As for what Israel expected them to do, I can't tell you right now it doesn't involve running out to take pictures of mutilated victims and slam 2x4's and sticks into their dead bodies when Hamas hauls them around Gaza.

That's all fringe lunatic behavior.

&gt;The Israeli government has made it clear that their end goal also includes the complete expulsion or killing of all Palestinians, militant or not.  

I'll be real honest. 1) I don't think Israel is trying to kill all the Palestinians in Gaza. 2) Israel has done a super shitty job of managing the highly reactive group of people who have been trying their best to outright kill them for 75 years. 3) Palestinians attacked Israel literally the day after it came into being. They chose violence RIGHT FROM THE START AND HAVEN'T STOPPED FOR 75 YEARS. 4) Most Palestinians don't believe in Israel's right to exist. 5) Even other Middle East leaders understand the primary problem is Palestinians. That's why they'll give them high fives and pay lip service to their cause all day long as well as some emergency supplies but THEY WILL NOT JOIN THE FIGHT and THEY WILL NOT TAKE IN PALESTINIANS REFUGEES. Palestinians have turned on every single country that has ever offered them refuge, tried or successfully assassinated the leaders of the host countries, started civil wars in those countries, Attempted to literally take the countries over or at least start a state within a state instead of living by the host country's rules and they even levied taxes on Jordanian citizens at one time to help fund their never ending war with Israel. Nobody trusts them anymore and for good reason. 6) Arab countries are slowly evolving past the idea of automatically turning to violence to solve every problem. Palestinians have yet to understand you can't murder your way to statehood. No one wants to get involved with Palestinians and get drug back into the horrific violence that Palestinians see as the best solution to get what they want. 7) The world needs to see Palestinians, particularly the ones in Gaza take responsibility for their own poor past decisions, turn away from the epic violence they've wallowed in for the last 75 years and earn back all the trust they lost over the years. Yeah, Israel needs to clean up their act too but they can't make any accommodations to Palestinians now because it will be looked at giving them a reward for atrocious behavior. Hamas has screwed over Palestinians in Gaza for the next generation or two at least. 8)  The population rate of the West Bank and Gaza is among the highest in the world: 3.4 percent in the West Bank and 4.0 percent in Gaza, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. 45% of the West Bank population are children under 15 years of age as well as 50% in Gaza.

There's no real argument about fact that they do hate Israelis, and they wanted to kill Israeli civilians. The fact there were armed guards that they killed, doesn't somehow make breaking into people's homes and slaughtering the families hiding inside more of a ""gray area"". 

No, these aren't equally ""deliberate, unforgiveable and demonic"". No, it doesn't prove the IDF is as bad as Hamas. One is clearly a tragic mistake. The other is clearly an intentional torture and murder of civilians. And you failed to make any compelling argument to the contrary. 

&gt;If Israel warns people before they bomb anywhere (leaflets, SMS's, roofknockers etc.), even forgetting about the 30,000+ dead, how is it possible that according to the IDF, 10000+ Hamas operatives have been killed. **Are Hamas operatives illiterate to warnings?**

Israel doesn't warn Hamas operatives before it bombs them. In this operation, it cleared all of Gaza, and then starting bombing Hamas assets. Hamas didn't all run away with the civilians, because:

1. They want to protect these assets. I.e. tunnels, rocket silos, weapon storages, military HQs, and so on.

2. They *want* to fight Israelis. It's literally the point of their organization. 

Beyond that, I'm not sure what argument you're trying to make here. Since Hamas extensively uses the war crime of Perfidy and hides behind its civilian population, any measures Israel could possibly take to protect Palestinian civilians, could also be used to protect Hamas. At most, you're arguing that it's very hard for Israel to make any measures that effectively protect civilians, while also fighting Hamas. Which is undeniably true. But it's not a black mark on Israel, let alone proof it ""targets civilians"".

&gt;If you think the Gaza Health Ministry casualty count is incorrect, how many Gazans do YOU think have died?

I feel the overall number is a good estimate, judging by similar conflicts. I feel the demographic breakdown, where the vast majority are women and children, and only a tiny minority are fighting-age men, is nonsense. With that sense, I feel the main reason, is because [it stopped relying on actual hospital records somewhere in December, and started using ""media reports"".](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/gaza-fatality-data-has-become-completely-unreliable) The actual hospital records tell a [far more believable story](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/sites/default/files/styles/partial_width_uncropped/public/2024-03/fatality-demographics-methodology-POL3851-fig2.jpg?itok=bfIoCKT-). 

I'd also note that Hamas employs both women and children (teenagers). So Israel's \~50% civilian/combatant casualty rate is pretty reasonable, even without every combat-aged male being a combatant.

&gt;Why do you claim that Palestinians deserve death because they voted in Hamas

I don't believe the Palestinian civilians ""deserve death"" because they voted in Hamas, or even because they supported the Oct. 7 massacre. Just like I don't think the innocent Japanese civilians ""deserved death"". However, what you're arguing against, is the abstract concept of war. This isn't the first, last or even only war that's currently happening. International law is built with innocent civilians dying in mind, even without concluding they ""deserve death"". Nobody argues that every war where civilians die, means either it's an ""unjustifiable crime"" or that the civilians ""deserved to die"".

If we judge Israel by the standards of any other nation, the war against Hamas is one of the most justified counter-attacks in modern history. Hamas' decision to hide behind their civilian population is criminal, and doesn't make them immune to Israeli attacks. The civilian/combatant ratio is relatively good, compared to conflicts of these kinds. Overt atrocities on the Israeli side are relatively low, and/or unproven. On par with Western conduct in its recent wars, and far better than the conduct of, say, Russia. So far, the IDF didn't carry out a Bucha, or even the Mahmudiyah rape and killings. 

&gt;Are you not forgetting this region has been radicalised literally for 80 years?

I'm not sure what you're arguing here. That Arabs, possibly all Muslims, are just a violent race, that cannot be ""deradicalized"", unlike the Germans? I feel that's a horrible, bleak conclusion. And, I'd add, something that Americans thought about the Germans as well. The famous Milgram Experiments in the 1960's were originally based on the assumption that the murderous actions of the Germans in WW2 were a result of a unique German character, and planned to use the Americans as a control group. He never got to Germany, because he found out that's not the case.

&gt;If you care about hostages so much, why do you continue to bomb them, restrict aid into Gaza, target their captors (the only people who have access and know where the hostages are being imprisoned) and jeopardise their lives?

Because Israelis generally feel stopping Hamas from being a government and an army is more important than rescuing the hostages. Saving a 100 lives is important. Saving thousands from the next Oct. 7th attacks, is more important. That's why Israel agrees to humiliating concessions for a ceasefire, like releasing arch-murderers from jail, but rejects Hamas' main demand: for Israel to withdraw, and allow Hamas to remain as the ruler of Gaza, and rebuild their army.

The reason some Israelis are protesting, is for two reasons: either they disagree on that calculus, or they feel Netanyahu is dragging his feet, and should go into Rafah ASAP. The hostage families are divided between those two groups as well, the pro-hostage-deal Hostages and Missing Families Forum vs. the pro-destroying-Hamas Hope (Tikvah) Forum.

&gt;Why do you believe Hamas when they say they want to attack Israel again and again, and yet not believe Hamas when they say they want a ceasefire, or that they did not deliberately target civilians on Oct 7, or that they do not use human shields, or the casualty numbers

Arguing for your interest vs. arguing against your interest. The fact the first statement makes a lot of sense, to anyone who knows anything about Hamas, and the second statement is disproven by a mountain of evidence.

I don't think anyone really argues about whether Hamas wants a ceasefire. Hamas wants a ceasefire, on its own terms. Israel wants a ceasefire on their own terms. Neither side wants an unconditional ceasefire, and neither side argues otherwise. 

&gt;Why do you believe Hamas when they say they want to attack Israel again and again, indicating their genocidal intent, and yet whenever an Israeli minister says something similar about Gaza you claim ""they do not represent government policy""

Because Israel has a multi-party coalition government. The statements of a party that got 10% or even 20% of the vote, isn't representative of the entire Israeli government, by definition. And that's without going into statements that were retracted or simply misrepresented.

Hamas is a single party. These statements didn't come from a random Hamas member, but from their official spokesperson. And as far as I know, they weren't retracted. 

&gt;Why is it that Israel always claim that they will thoroughly investigate an atrocity that Israel has committed - and yet we never see the results of that investigation? For example, how is the investigation into the deaths of the 3 naked Israeli hostages shot by the IDF going? Any updates to that?

The investigation concluded the obvious: it was an honest, if tragic mistake. The soldiers were removed from that particular theater, but since it's neither a criminal nor disciplinary offense, but a tragic mistake, they weren't punished beyond that. Whatever new regulations were put in place to prevent that, however, are obviously confidential - if they weren't, they'd be immediately used by Hamas.

This, incidentally, the reason why ""you never see the results of the investigations"". No army is ever going to publish the full results of the investigation, unless it's something like My Lai or Kafr Qasim, that leads to a public trial. Your expectations for transparency from the Israeli army are not reasonable, and are not in line with international standards. Even the fact Israel often shares the classified results with the US, is already more than most armies would do.

&gt;IDF could find out the facts about Oct 7 within 24 hours

I'm not sure what you're talking about here. Israel is still very much in the middle of the investigation of the events of Oct 7. It will take years to complete. Even arriving at the exact number of dead took them a month. 

If you mean the basic facts that on Oct 7, lots of terrorists poured from Gaza and attacked Israeli villages, Israelis literally found out about that live, via live streams as this attack was happening, via people calling news stations live on air and saying they're hiding in their safe rooms while terrorists are in their homes, via news reporters driving up to the South and seeing a bunch of executed Israeli civilians... I'm not sure why you find this surprising.

&gt;If Hamas lies, why not allow international media into Gaza?

I don't care about this either. Palestinians and their supporters like do a little bait and switch were literally every depraved, awful thing Hamas or Palestinians do is somehow Israel's fault.

Enough already.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Before October 7th there really wasn't sizeable terrorist attacks to speak of

This is you intentionally or unintentionally misunderstanding the situation on the ground there.

There have been [hundreds of thousands](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/palestinian-rocket-and-mortar-attacks-against-israel) of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza since Hamas was elected to office killing thousands of people over the years. Pretending this is no big deal is disingenuous and cruel.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Iron Dome and the wall took care of that.

Iron Dome costs $50,000 per rocket. The US has spent over $1.5 billion (Â£1.2b) on the Iron Dome program simply so Hamas terrorists could continue their mindless violence against Israel day after endless day. Everyone else in the world shouldn't have to rearrange their societies around Palestinian violence. Pretending like this is no big deal is disingenuous

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And it's not like vital supplies Gaza needed for water infrastructure like cement would help them build a weapon that could get past Iron Dome.

Israel, Egypt and Jordan all closed their borders to create the blockade. They did that to cut down on Palestinians smuggling contraband and weapons into Gaza. Pretending like Hamas is just a regular run of the mill government trying to build infrastructure and provide for their people is bordering on hilarious. Hamas' goal was not to smuggle in concrete for building projects.

Egypt discovered Hamas had dug a tunnel under their border and were smuggling everything they needed for the war effort, including fuel. The thing is, fuel in Egypt is heavily subsidized by the government, so the Egyptian government was inadvertently supporting terrorism without knowing it. Of course Egypt had to come and go through the time and trouble of making the tunnel inoperable in order to stop the smuggling of arms and fuel.

Since you are apparently unaware, Hamas smuggled in technology and parts from Iran to make rockets with targeting mechanisms. So yeah, they were slowly becoming more sophisticated and technologically advanced.

Just so you know, the expectation is that Hamas shoot zero rockets over the border because the iron drone doesn't get every single one of the rockets. Accidents happen and Israeli's do get hurt and killed. Nothing about this is okay but we've lowered to the bar so low for Palestinians that attacking Israel almost every single day is somehow just no big deal in a lot of people's minds.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not rewarding them for October 7th. It's more of a wakeup call.

Palestinians are the ones that need a wake up call. Their ongoing mindless violence is clearly putting them in danger of being wiped off the face of the earth (according to you).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If Israel continues on this path the only solution will be the final solution.

I don't necessarily disagree with this statement. When you have a group of people who want something so bad that they're willing to reorder their entire society around mindless violence, hatred of the other, reverence for martyrdom and glorify terrorist, the answer is to expect them to cast aside the idea that violence will get them what they want. It's not to expect the people they victimize to accommodate their thrice defeated ideals.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I know they hope that neighboring countries will just take them, they hope they can just do an ethnic cleansing, but I doubt it's going to work out that way.

Of course it won't work out that way. No other country will take in Palestinian refugees because every single time they have, those Palestinians have turned on them and tried to take over the place.

Remember Black September, when Jordan took in refugees and they tried to create a state within a state and began levying taxes against Jordan's citizens to fund their never-ending war against Israel. When their king asked them to stop the Palestinians tried to kill him and take over Jordan. Some people say the king of Jordan only took Queen Noor as his forth wife to appease the Palestinians and keep the peace.

Remember when Lebanon took in a bunch of Palestinians refugees and they were instrumental in instigating a civil war that costs between 80k and 100k lives. It took such a toll on the country that they are only just now recovering fully.

Then there was Kuwait where they sided with Saddam Hussein when he invaded in 1990.  287,000 Palestinians were thrown out after the war when the US came riding to the rescue.

Palestinians have proven themselves both unable to self-govern and to be totally ungovernable even by other Arabs. They won't follow any rules that get in the way of destroying Israel so I think they are sealing their own fate.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The only way this ends without Israelis becoming the very same monsters who persecuted them is for them to start helping the Palestinians build a future as their neighbors.

Israel will never ""become the very same monsters who persecuted them"" because the difference is that they were not attacking, raping and murdering Germans when WWII broke out.

850,5/29/2024 22:38,"&gt; First off, settlements do take up some land in the West Bank, but saying they take up 59% is misleading.Â 

What is misleading is just counting the built up area. 

Palestinians are barred from developing 59% of the West Bank - through a variety of means.

 70% of Area C is inside regional council areas, which block Palestinian development. Another 29% is inside firing zones or ""nature reserves"", which leaves 1% of Area C zoned for Palestinian development. 

So that's how you get to 59% of the West Bank. 

&gt; The built-up area of settlements is actually much smaller.  The areas you mention include large swathes of land around settlements that aren't necessarily built upon and can be a bit inflated when cited without context.

Sure.

But the built up area is not that important - what is important about how much land is blocked from Palestinian use. 

Just since 2018, settlers have grabbed 7% of the West Bank - more than the built up area. 

&gt; The Second Intifada and continuous attacks have caused Israelis to lose faith in a peace process that might not bring security.Â 

And never-ending settlement expansion has made Palestinians lose faith in the peace process.

There's not a single year when there hasn't been West Bank land grabs. 

Besides, your argument isn't really a reason as to ""why"". Why, exactly, should Israel keep grabbing occupied territory and entrench the occupation? Isn't that illogical - making peace less likely?

That is an active Israeli policy choice. You can't blame it on someone else, any more than you can blame Hamas terrorism on Israel. 

&gt; This dual system originates from the Oslo Accords, which intended for eventual Palestinian self-governance.

No, this is incorrect.

The separate and unequal legal system originated in the Emergency Regulations implemented by the Knesset soon after the occupation - and the settlements - started. 

This is long before the Oslo accords. 

That is, one set of laws for Israeli settlers, one set of laws for Palestinians. Different rights - like as it comes to search warrants. 

&gt; Â The complexity arises from the West Bank's status as a disputed territory with no final status agreement. While this results in disparities, it's more about the unresolved political status rather than racial segregation. It's a deeply flawed system, but it's also a product of a long-standing and unresolved conflict, not a deliberate policy of apartheid.

This is misleading. The inequality before the law is there because the Knesset decided on it. 

By default, settlers would be subject to the same Israeli military courts as Palestinians. 

Knesset actively decided they didn't want that, and extended the emergency regulations to the West Bank - and have been renewing it ever since.

If the Knesset wanted equality before the law in the West Bank, they could just let the emergency regulations lapse. 

&gt; Lastly, if we're talking about the viability of peace, it's not just about what Israel does or doesn't do. There needs to be a partner on the Palestinian side committed to a peaceful resolution too. The leadership needs to be willing to come to the table and genuinely negotiate, without inciting violence.

For the past decades, Abbas has been ready - but Israel has not. Bibi - repeatedly elected by the Israeli electorate - is very clear that he does not want peace. 

Abbas, on the other hand, is open to negotiations. Remember when Lapid rebuffed Abbas for negotiations?

It is the Palestinians that don't have a partner for peace.

&gt;7. some adjectives right describe Hamas or the Israeli leaders

Netanyahu is corrupt (carrying more about his position than his own people) and Sinwar is a psychopath. 

&gt;8. if there was a wife swap or freaky Friday version of Israel- Palestine and Netanyahu was in charge of Palestine and Hamas with Israel how do you think it would go?

Netanyahu is a very passive man who wouldn't take risks and wouldn't do a single thing from his position.

So during this time Gaza would be fairly peaceful.

As for Hamas leaders' as Israel's prime minister... Not much would change considering they are very corrupt (even more than Netanyahu) as well and don't care a lot about their people.

However they are radical enough to attack Iran back the moment it dared to attack Israel.

So funny enough, this might be a better option for Israel.

&gt;9. if you were the leaders of Israel or Palestine what would you do to make each place better or how would you try to solve the war?

Leading Hamas is easy, leading Israel less...

For Hamas, I would have acknowledged the fact my people are suffering, Israel is way stronger and what happened almost 80 years ago should not impact what will happen.

I would have released all the hostages, apologize to Israel and my people about all the suffering and would work hard to fix the education at Gaza in order to raise a peaceful generation. Only then I would have dared to offer Israel a peace deal.

As for Israel, I would have done a few things.

1. Attack Iran back the moment it dared to attack me. In the middle east people only understand power and what Iran attempted to do what unforgettable. + It's about time the Iranian nuclear reactor would be destroyed.

2. I would have entered Rafah long ago. This war is not healthy for anyone and just like bandage it's better to just get in and do what is needed, of course after slowly moving the population somewhere else slowly - making sure no Hamas leader sneaks with them. 

3. I would have created an official marketing office with the goal of actually creating marketing tools for Israel and its people especially for the younger generation so the people of the world will finally hear Israel's side.

4. I would have attacked Hezbollah because similarly to Iran, there's no way I'm letting them get away without a punishment.

5. For the day after the war, my first priority would have been to try and give it to Egypt but they will 100% refuse. I don't want to govern them but it's even worse when they do it themselves. So I would offer other countries Israel can trust to do it. But if they will refuse my last plan is simply. If the Palestinian government want to control Gaza they need to prove themselves. They have one year to stop paying terrorists, stop teaching students about terrorism and in general stop attacking Israel using terror organizations from the area. They do that, they get Gaza under Israeli supervision that can take it away from them at any time. If they don't, well - we're already at plan D so let's hope one of those 3 plans will work...",Neutral

2, What would be the consequence of not fighting? ""Just let the occupation happen""? Is that the definition of ""peace"" for Israel?

3. You ware flipping the victim and the perpetrator: Israel decides to drop a bomb on a refugee camp, so it's their fault. It's like a rapist would blame the victims father for not protecting her daugther.

4. It is Israel, that is acting so aggressively. No one forced them to drop a bomb on crowded places. You want to kill Hamas? Then do a ground operation without bombs.

5. 

&gt;Hamas has carried out suicide bombings and over the years fired tens of thousands of increasingly powerful rockets from Gaza into Israel.

Are you kidding me? Look up, how many have been killed. Even from 2001-2009, so BEFORE Iron Dome was installed, around 18 people died from over 6000 rockets. That's 2 people killed per year. These rockets are fireworks.

Even right now, you could force a temp government established by UN and put things in order. Netanyahu and zionist mentallity doesn't want palestinians to have a proper government. They want them to leave/die/run out of their homes so that zionists can fulfill greater israel dream (again, check UN meeting from sept 2023)

No? I'm not sure how that's relevant. I think you're trying to imply that Zionism = conquering someone else land in order to establish your state which I disagree with, your following questions actually give an anvenue to answer this coincidentally.

&gt;But 20+ years of foreign zionist terrorism? No... The violent ethnic cleansing of 700k+ native Palestinians to ""form the only democracy in the middle east...

Ah I figured this is where you were going with that. Having ancestors to a homeland doesn't mean you can kill it's inhabitants. Nor does it mean it's ok to displace people in order to create your state. That's why the Balfour Declaration (1917) made it explicity clear, that the British would support a Jewish National Home, without infringing on the rights of local non Jews.

&gt;""His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.""

And the World Zionist Conference in 1921 repeated that exact same language when talking about establishing a state.

And that is also why, the 1947 UN Parition Plan, that was approved by a majority of the UN, didn't call for expelling anyone, or ""population transferring"" as it was called, in order to establish both a **Jewish** ***and*** **an Arab State**. People would become citizens in their respective states AND have the right to declare their intent for citizenship in the other state up to one year after the 1947 plan went into effect. **It specifically didn't call for expelling anyone**. The Jewish Agency agreed to the plan, while the Arab League rejected it outright. In fact, the Arab side didn't even, according to the UNSCOP committee, participate in the investigation that preceeded the 1947 plan, which aimed to interview both sides to figure out the best solution.

This non participation was generally in line with the Arabs stance. The Arabs had long felt that if they protested by non compliance, eventually the British would give in and appease them. However, this ultimately backfired in the long run, and they missed out in several key negotiations such as the Peel Commisison by refusing to participate, or were heavily abrasive i.e the London Confernce, which came after the Arabs rejected the Peel Commission Report (aka Palestine Royal Commission Report).

People often misquote or imply the UN Parition plan calls for expelling Arabs, if people who said that actually took the time to read it, which I painfully did... It does not.

Now, if you're talking about the first Arab-Israeli war, and the subseuqent consequences and fallout from Israel's war for independence, after the UN Partition Plan failed, after a prolonged civil war prior, after the Arab Legions invasion of the region (who also wanted to acquire as much land as possible), then yea, that's not really the same as the above.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, three officers, one of whom is serving in Gaza, questioned Netanyahu's strategy in the ongoing war on Gaza.
One officer told MEE the government's aims were unclear and the objective of rescuing captives and destroying Hamas had ""collapsed"".
""Netanyahu's operations in Gaza are fundamentally aimed at hunting down Yahya Sinwar,"" said the officer in Gaza, adding that the war had become ""personal"" for the Israeli premier.
Sinwar, Hamas's leader in the enclave, is Israel's number one target and has not been seen in public since the war began.
Last month, a Hamas official said Sinwar had visited combat zones above the ground and held deliberations with the group's leadership abroad.
The military officer in Gaza said that conducting special operations targeting high-ranking individuals in a densely populated area risked making the conflict
""perpetual"", and would be impossible without Israeli casualties and subsequent ""retaliations"" by the army.
An officer not currently serving in Gaza said a ""new phase"" of the war was being planned involving a long-term military presence through special operations.
""This plan has been partially approved by the US,"" the officer told MEE. ""It's all part of a plan agreed upon by the two countries for a Hamas-free Gaza.""

The US has previously said it opposes the re-occupation of Gaza or re-establishing a permanent
Israeli presence there.
Israel has repeatedly said its main war objectives remain ""returning our hostages and eliminating
Hamas""
Israel estimates that 128 of around 250 captives taken to Gaza during Hamas's surprise attack on Israel in October remain there, including 35 who the military says are dead. Hamas says at least 70 captives have been killed in Israeli air strikes.

&gt; Support for Hamas has more than tripled in the West Bank compared to three months ago. In the Gaza Strip, support for Hamas increased but not significantly. Despite the increase in its popularity, the majority in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip does not support Hamas. It is worth noting that support for Hamas usually rises temporarily during or immediately after a war and then returns to the previous level several months after the end of the war.

Well thatâs interesting isnât it? Support has increased but the majority still do not support Hamas _and_ this is typical for a war with that support declining again after the war is over.

&gt; We asked respondents to speculate about Hamasâ reasons for waging its October the 7th offensive: a response to attacks on al Aqsa and to release prisoners as Hamas claimed or an Iranian plot to thwart Arab normalization with Israel. The overwhelming majority (81%; 89% in the West Bank and 69% in the Gaza Strip) said it was a âresponse to settler attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque and on Palestinian citizens and for the release of prisoners from Israeli prisons;â while only 14% (5% in the West Bank and 27% in the Gaza Strip) thought it was an Iranian plot.

If they believe that the attacks on October 7th were a direct retaliation for violence, is it really surprising that there is support for them? Then if you add some further context:

&gt; 85% say they did not see videos, shown by international news outlets, showing acts committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians, such as the killing of women and children in their homes; only 14% (7% in the West Bank and 25% in the Gaza Strip) saw these videos.

And:

&gt; When asked if Hamas did commit these atrocities, the overwhelming majority said no, it did not and only 7% (1% in the West Bank and 16% in the Gaza Strip) said it did.

The support for Hamas seems a little less evil and realistically just unfortunately ignorant. These people might support Hamas but mostly because they have seen Israeli violence and not been exposed to evidence of Hamas terror, or question the evidence (which is unsurprising given the control Hamas has of Gaza), however, as from the first point:

A genocide has to include intent to kill every person of a certain race. The war cabinet, the defence minister and the prime minister have repeatedly said that they don't have any intent of occupying gaza nor kill or displace its civilians.

The operation by the IDF is doing a lot of protecting Israelis. Again, it cripples hamas' capability of ever doing what they did on October 7th ever again which I may remind you that they managed to take control of military bases near the gaza strip. 

The IDF has issued countless warnings before every attack weather through leaflets dropped from the air, phone calls and texts. In his first every public message to the Israeli public, netanyahu also urged the Palestinians in gaza to evacuate from the north to the south. Israel allowed humanitarian aid in, protected humanitarian corridors with tanks from hamas, offered fuel to hospitals, set up a safe zone in the south near the beach and did so so much more in order to protect civilians yet you call it a genocide. Stupidity.

The second paragraph just tells me how little you know about how war works. It's terrible that any innocent people die but if you stand/are being held near a rocket launcher that was set in a school/hospital/masque you're going to get hurt and possibly die. And when those weapons are stationed all over gaza and always near civilians a lot are going to get hurt.

23,000 people died in gaza 9,000 of them are hamas terrorists. That puts the ratio between innocent and terrorist deaths at ,1:1.45 which is an astonishingly good ratio so stop the crap.

I also need to remind you that Israel already gave gaza its freedom in 2005 when they left gaza completely. Hamas took over, started a civil war and has used its civilians ever since. This caused both Israel and eygpt to blockade the stip. Furthermore, it has been 17 years since Israel left gaza and in those 17 years thr ceasefire between the two was broken 20 times. 2 times by Israel and 18 times by hamas.

* The rescue of the two \[hostages\] had been planned for a long time, but the conditions for its success have recently improved, precisely in the days when the world is warning Israel of a humanitarian disaster if it operates in Rafah.
* The Shin Bet monitored the location of Luis and Fernando in the last few weeks, but only when the exact location of the shared house where they were located was arrived at, it was decided to greenlight the operation.
* There were Palestinian families in the shared apartment building, and the forces took this into account during the raid itself.
* The rescue was made possible because the Shvura neighborhood, where the building where the two were held, and considered one of the most ""Hamasified"" neighborhoods in Rafah, was located, is adjacent to Khan Yunis - where the IDF forces are located. Thus, some of the rescue teams were able to move on foot to the building
* The operation was postponed from time to time - before it was finally decided to carry it out. Those who approved it were Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant. There was a lot of tension before and during the rescue, the IDF noted.
* The forces worked for a long time to prepare for the operation, which included the descent of the soldiers from a great height
* The operation included many risks, training and preliminary models, and it was conducted close to 1:00am in the morning. In total, the operation took about an hour, from the first shot to the disengagement. The helicopter landing pad was not close to the scene and armored forces with 7th Brigade tanks accompanied the special forces to the helicopter.
* The forces secretly arrived at the premises of a building where the hostages were kept on the second floor. The operation included covert work with an air and ground covering. In order to penetrate the target, which included armed Hamas guards, also in nearby buildings, the forces used an explosive device to break open a locked door, fired at nearby points by forces on the ground and from the air, and thus succeeded in extracting the two elderly hostages.
* At this point, fire was opened from the building and nearby buildings. A lengthy battle took place, and at the same time dozens of Hamas targets were attacked from the air to allow the force to leave the building with only a minor injury to our forces, who was hit via a fall from a height and via being shot. The force disengaged while under cover and arrived at a prearranged point with a helicopter that took off with the hostages to Sheba \[Hospital\], where the hostages meet their families.
* In the planning and exercises of the operation, scenarios of complication and disruption were taken into account that did not ultimately occur, thanks to the familiarity of the combined force that included the fighters of the Yamam and the operational unit of the Shin Bet, who had already operated together in dozens of operations in other sectors in recent years, mainly in the terrorist strongholds of northern Samaria.",Neutral

977,5/14/2024 1:30,"JL Peeke writes about the origins of Zionism:

&gt; With a tremendous amount of hindsight, one can see that the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 had its beginnings in the Roman conquest of the Judean state in the first century of the Christian era and the subsequent dispersion of the Jews throughout the world. The Jews of the ""Diaspora,"" as the scattered nation was called, maintained themselves as special, separate communities, and were outcasts in every state in which they appeared. They were not allowed to participate in public life and given their tenacious grip on their unique political, religious, and economic characteristics, were exiled at one time or another in almost every European state. Even in a liberalized 19th century Europe, Jews failed to become assimilated as Poles, Russians, English or French, but remained Jews. And throughout the dispersion the Jews never relinquished their claim on the Holy Land.
&gt;
&gt; The most indicative of these ties to Palestine are the words of the closing prayer of the Passover festival, ""next year in Jerusalem."" Although Jews were resettling in Palestine as early as the 14th century, for the most part these people were apolitical; the immigrants were few and they were spiritually motivated. While Western Europe was liberalizing itself in the 19th century, Eastern European and Russian ""pogroms"" against the Jewish population were driving Jewish immigrants to the United States and Western Europe. The widespread persecutions in the 1880s prompted creation of Jewish social ""clubs"" to alleviate the condition of Russian and Polish Jewry. The foremost club in the movement was Hoveve Zion (Lovers of Zion) which advocated immigration to Palestine to escape Russian persecution. Only a small number of Russian Jews managed to settle in the Holy Land. The first of a very few settlements was Rishon le-Zion (First in Zion) founded in 1882.
&gt;
&gt; The modern politicisation of Zionism is the result of Theodor Herzl, an Hungarian-born Jewish author, whose book The Jewish State, published in 1895, serves as the foundation for political Zionism. Greatly influenced by the rampant anti-Semitism provoked by the trial of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, Herzl realized the impossibility of satisfactory Jewish integration into European life. Herzl's book made Jewry aware that persecution would be a way of life as long as the Jews were a nation without a state (Theodor Herzl did not consider Palestine as the sole location of this state, he suggested Argentina as well). [Herzlâs book] The Jewish State prompted much discussion, and, in 1897,  Herzl convened the first World Zionist Congress in Basle, Switzerland. At this Congress the foundations of the World Zionist Organization were formed to ""create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine secured by public law."" After the Congress, Herzl wrote ""... at Basle I founded the Jewish State. If I were to say this today, I would be met by universal laughter. In five years, perhaps, and certainly in fifty, everyone will see it."" By the start of WWI, Herzl's Zionism had grown. A Jewish Colonial Trust and a Jewish National Fund was created to purchase land in Palestine for settlement by Jewish immigrants.
&gt;
&gt; Prior to the First World War, the actual establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine was a moot question. There was no ""Palestine."" The ruling Ottomans had divided the area between the Villayets of Beirut and Syria and the Sanjuk of Jerusalem. The ""Sublime Porte"" would not consider a new state carved from its Empire although immigration to Palestine was sanctioned. In 1905, Russian pogroms caused the migration of young socialist revolutionaries to the Holy Land. These new arrivals founded Hashomer (Watchmen) to protect their settlements from marauding bedouin warriors.
&gt;
&gt; The outbreak of WWI caused the Ottomans to tighten their control of the area and many Zionists were persecuted and exiled for being subversive. Immigration to Palestine ground to a halt.
&gt;
&gt; In a series of complicated, confusing and conflicting agreements, Great Britain, in the prosecution of the war, promised areas under ottoman control, especially Palestine, to Arabs, Jews, France and herself, thereby exacerbating the situation and creating a great portion of the current unrest in the area today:

982,5/13/2024 14:36,"Bonus point that I remembered while writing this longass rant. I get it. Hamas kill people. Hamas bad. Hamas terrorist group. If Hamas members disbanded and formed another new organization under a different name and tried to form a Palestinian government, it would still be basically Hamas. Yahya Sinwar is the leader of Hamas. If he became the leader of said new organization, he would still be the leader of a terrorist group. 

If you can agree with the above, then surely you can agree that Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi were terrorist organizations that formed the backbone of the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine which led to the creation of the State of Israel and later disbanded and formed the Israeli government and IDF when Israel declared independence in 1948. These organizations perpetrated the King David Hotel Bombing, Saliha massacre, Deir Yassin massacre, Lydda massacre, Tantura massacre, and the Abu-Shusha massacre just to name a few. However, I bet Israelis view them as heroic, patriotic, freedom fighters. But god forbid Palestinians see Hamas in the same way, then they are terrorist sympathizers. 
Menachem Begin, was the leader of Irgun and later became the Prime Minister of Israel. Can you imagine if Yahya Sinwar became President of the State of Palestine? Everyone would be up in arms. 

I want to close off by reiterating and emphasizing that I am CERTAIN that I harbor not an ounce of antisemitism or any form of hatred towards Jews whatsoever. Antisemitism is disgusting and abhorrent and should be unequivocally condemned. My problem is with Zionism the political ideology, not Judaism the religious ideology. If anyone conflates the two, that is their problem and not mine. I understand that there is a lot of overlap between those two groups but I would be remiss if I didnât point out that there are many Jews that are not Zionists and many Zionists that are not Jews, so they cannot be considered one and the same. 

The good parts of Israel and Jewish society in general are truly remarkable and admirable. Jewish cultureâs emphasis on education has led to astonishing advancements and incredible innovations in so many fields. Itâs no wonder why 22% of Nobel prize winners are Jewish. They absolutely deserve it. Jews built âan oasis in the desertâ as they like to say regarding Israel. And honestly theyâre not completely wrong. Israel has the highest standard of living in the Middle East for Jews and a handful of Arabs. But thatâs the bright side. The dark side that nobody ever wants to acknowledge is the fact that 750,000 people were dispossessed of their land during the establishment of the nation and over 5 million are still under complete or partial occupation today. All of Israelâs and Jewsâ achievements are laudable but they donât have to be done in Israel. They can be done in America, Europe, or dare I say, the Middle East when it finally gets its shit together. Jews have the right to security and prosperity, but not at the expense of the self determination of another group of people, even if that group of people may not be as progressive as them.",Pro-Palestine

Also today, a Hamas spokesperson said they do have 40 people to release that meets the guidelines of the first ceasefire. This was after saying a couple of weeks ago they had less than 20.

Hamas realizes the Rafah operation is actually going to happen. So they start drumming up propaganda that includes psychological warfare of the hostage families. These families loudly want a ceasefire at any cost, including their own future if Hamas is left intact, to get their families back. I would do the same if a loved one was in hell as a Hamas captive.

The point of todayâs Hamas propaganda was:

First by hinting they have more hostages alive than previously thought. They actually have enough hostages left to make a good faith ceasefire deal.

Second by showing the son of one of Timeâs most influential people of the year. They know she has a voice that will work in their favor. They hope she will help turn tides to a ceasefire deal.

&gt;Zionists often praise Israel as a beacon of human rights in the Middle East, but if we compare Israel with other developed countries, Israel's human rights situation is almost the worst among all developed countries (perhaps a little better than Singapore), ordinary democracy ï¼bad press freedom, poor minority and lgbt rights.

While we can discuss how democratic Israel is compared to other democracies, I don't understand the point of it to begin with... After all, you said ""beacon of human rights in the Middle East"" not in Europe and not in north America. Not only the conditions are different (it's much easier to live a peaceful territory + Israel doesn't try to be the most democratic country on the planet but rather a combination of a Jewish country \[involve Jewish culture and religion in the laws\] with democracy \[free elections, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc..\]) but you also need to compare Israel to other countries in the middle east and to check if Israel fits the criteria of a democracy.

Does is have free elections, equal rights for its civilians and everything a country needs to be considered a democracy by the official requirements? yes.

Is it more democratic than any other country in the middle east? 100% yes and by ALOT.

So we already solved this problem.

I have noticed increased censorship in Israel, a decline in free speech, and increased threats of violence against other ethnic groups in Israel. All this means that Israeli human rights are in jeopardy.

Let's go one by one, first about the war - Israel literally only need to enter Rafah for the war with Hamas (not talking about Hezbollah or Iran) to end. They want to do this but the world put pressure not to, so obviously the war will take forever if the world put it on an infinite pause... Let Israel do whatever it needs to do and let the war finish already.

About Israel's freedom of speech and censoreship, based on what do you say so? Because Israel tried to ban Al-Jazeera from publishing anti-Israeli propaganda from within Israel? Last time I checked, freedom of speech has its limits and there's a difference between objective news to Defeatist propaganda. Btw, there are laws against Defeatist propaganda in many countries, however for some reason some countries just seem to ignore them.

Last time I checked news papers and organizations like Haaretz or B'tzelem still spread Defeatist propaganda and got no punishment so again I'm asking - based on what do you claim that?

This despite the constant barrage of negative PR and misleading stories coming out that paint Israel in a bad light without context, which have gone on since the start of this war: the Al Ahli Hospital being the first example, the aid convoys that Hamas fired on being the latest, and all those in between.

Most of these voters **do not care** about this enough to shift their votes, though. Biden is doing this because a very small subset are the only ones who will. That subset is the Muslim population in the US, which also has:

1) 37% have a favorable view of Hamas

2) 21% say the October 7 Massacre was acceptable, with just 49% disagreeing and the rest declining to answer

3) 54% say Israel has no valid reason to fight Hamas

1023,5/9/2024 16:17,"&gt;This is where I have the biggest problem with this post, what makes Ottoman rule of Palestine any more legitimate than British? This is a rhetorical question as literally nothing you can say will convince me Palestinian society that resulted from Ottoman imperialism is somehow more legitimate or âlegalâ than Israeli through the British.

In ww1, the allies promised the Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against the Ottoman Empire.  The Arabs revolted.

Palestine became a mandatory territory.

The purpose of the mandates was explicitly anti-colonial.  They were caretaker governments.  The role of the british was to do things like maintain infrastructure and help run local elections so that Palestine could become self-governing.  Palestine was not a part of the british empire.  Palestine was not a british territory or colony.

Palestine represents the basic human right of self-determination of the native people.

israel, on the other hand, is a terrorist entity formed by european terrorist immigrants/crusaders through terrorist violence and a violent revolt by foreign terrorists.

&gt;Palestine was imperially managed for millennia, there is nothing redeeming in its initial existence when compared to the Israeli state.

There was the Palestine peasants revolt in 1834.  And there was also, before the Jewish crusade, the Christian crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.

&gt;77 years after the British left and the region still isnât remotely stable, they may have had a point.

Maybe that's because the british armed, and trained european zionist terrorist militias that eventually revolted, and the british supported the zionist terrorist organizations creating their quasi government, while the british, with the help of the european zionist terrorists, violently repressed, killed, jailed, and exiled the native Palestinian leaders?

&gt;Dogwhistle. Nothing inherently immoral about it.

Yes, it is inherently immoral.

Say the US passed the Falwell declaration declaring the US governments militant support of a christian homeland in Palestine...  And then the US subsequently used it's military to protect Christian crusaders entering Palestine, with US arms and US military support, supplanting the local population.

&gt;What makes it illegal? What makes the nativesâ consent necessary? Who are they to own land they havenât even grazed, let alone occupied?

It's their homeland, it was land they'd occupied and grazed.

The native Palestinians have the basic human right of self-determination.

Somehow I doubt you'd agree that violent foreign crusaders can claim land in terrorist israel on any basis.

Is ungrazed, unoccupied land in terrorist israel up for grabs by anyone?

&gt;Every official document was in Hebrew and Arabic, it wasnât some hidden insidious secret.

The forces of Division 98 started an operation tonight in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, following intelligence information about the presence of terrorists and the restoration of terror infrastructures of the terrorist organization Hamas in the area. Before the entry of the forces, fighter jets and aircraft of the Air Force attacked about 30 terrorist targets in the area and eliminated a number of terrorists from the terrorist organization Hamas.

At the same time, the forces of Division 162 under the intelligence guidance of the intelligence division and Shin Bet continue their activity focused on east Rafah and the Rafah crossing on the Gaza side. During the operation, the combat team fighters of the Givati Brigade located and destroyed a number of tunnel shafts and rocket launchers that were ready to be launched into the country. In addition, the fighters of the 401st Brigade combat team identified ten terrorists from the terrorist organization Hamas leaving a house and carrying weapons. Air force aircraft and combat team fighters attacked the terrorists and eliminated them.

In Zeytun in the north of the Gaza Strip, the operations of the 99th Division continue against infrastructure and Hamas terrorists in the region. During the last day, the fighters eliminated a number of terrorists in face-to-face encounters, in air force aircraft strikes, additional terrorists were eliminated and weapons and terrorist infrastructure were destroyed. An Air Force aircraft eliminated two terrorists who shot at the forces operating in the area.

During the last day, aircraft and fighter jets of the Air Force attacked and destroyed more than 150 terrorist targets throughout the Gaza Strip in the coordination and direction of the ground forces. Among the targets attacked are ready-to-launch rocket launchers, terrorist squads and ammunition depots alongside military buildings, observation posts, tunnel shafts and other terrorist infrastructure.

One interesting note:

1038,5/8/2024 6:02,"Most Zionist supported the Allies in World War II not just for obvious reasons (Yishuv vs. Nazis was essentially fascist infighting at its peak), but to win favors. The Jewish Brigade was the successor to its counterpart from World War I, the Jewish Legion. The Jewish Brigade was a political stunt on the part of the British. For the Yishuv, it was part of a scheme to boost the political legitimacy of Zionism and raise a future army for later. Tens of thousands of Zionists were already fighting in regular British units. There was no reason to deploy a segregated Jewish unit with permission to fly their flag, let alone only months before the war ended. British officers had warned that it'd encourage a Zionist uprising, but Churchill ignored them. Christ, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was right to describe the Arab elites as traitors to Palestine. These elites had encouraged the Palestinians to call off the general strike during the revolution.

&gt;The Arab general strike was eventually called off in November 1936, by the HAC, under the influence of Britain. King Ghazi of Iraq, King Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia and Emir Abdullah of Transjordan appealed to the workers to end the strike because as they wrote in Palestinian newspapers, ""We rely on the good intentions of our friend Great Britain, who has declared that she will do justice.""

A lot of good that did them.

The British were gonna declare a Jewish state at the end of the war. What changed things was Lehi assassinating Lord Moyne in November 1944. Ironically, Moyne had supported a Jewish state, albeit his views were far more moderate. He'd supported an Arab federation of Palestine, Transjordan, and Syria, albeit on the condition of a Jewish state. For not being their mindless droid, Lehi thought Moyne had to die. This finally snapped the British to their senses and got them to shelve their plans. Even then, the Labour Party had supported Zionism more than the Conservatives. During their campaign in 1945, they'd promised to establish a Jewish state. They went as far as calling for population transfers, stating, ""Let the Arabs be encouraged to move out as the Jews move in."" After taking power, they voted to repeal the White Paper.

&gt;""We cannot accept the view that the Jews should be driven out of Europe and should not be permitted to live again in these countries without discrimination and contribute their ability and talent towards rebuilding the prosperity of Europe.""

However, the new Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, turned out to be an ideological anti-Zionist. Wanting to not only protect British hegemony, but fearing a ""racial state"", he rejected this vote and did a full-180 on British policy in Palestine. Enraged, Zionists rioted in Tel Aviv, only for British security forces to shoot over 60 of them, five of them fatally, put the entire city under curfew, and bring in armored cars to patrol the streets. With Bevin refusing to compromise with them, a war broke out between the British and the Zionists. Bevin deployed tens of thousands of soldiers to Palestine, intending to suppress the Zionist terrorist campaign in the Mandate. As this happened, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and other radicals sat in exile, watching them have at each other.

There was no point in becoming involved, not yet, not with this unexpected change. Ernest Bevin was doing the work for them. Far too strong to be beaten in a straight fight, the British now not only formed a convenient buffer against the Zionists, but were weakening their paramilitaries via counterinsurgency operations. From the looks of it, however, that buffer wasn't going to last. The British were weary from World War II and likely wouldn't have it in them to fight for much longer. Knowing this, the Zionists showed no signs of relenting. The Mandate should've collapsed by now, but Bevin had turned it into a police state, with 100,000 British soldiers and another 4,000 police officers maintaining order. In the meantime, the radicals prepared for war.

In September 1947, the British, exhausted, announced their plans to withdraw.

In November 1947, the UN Partition Plan was announced. The British abstained, not wanting to provoke either side. They knew the partition plan was morally wrong, but no longer had the political willpower to hold back the Zionists on their own. Bevin refused to enforce the terms against the Palestinians and expected them and the Arab states to fight back. Going forward, however, the British, beyond handing over many abandoned forts and weapons to the Arabs, officially provided far less direct help against the Zionists. Roughly 100 to 200 British soldiers and police officers, radicalized by the war, deserted to help the Palestinians. Otherwise, the Palestinians now stood alone. With the buffer breaking down, the Mandate fell into chaos and a civil war broke out.

In December 1947, Abd al-Qadir, leading the Army of the Holy War, arrived in Palestine. The British deserters proved to be surprisingly useful. Since they were Europeans, they could pass through Haganah checkpoints without scrutiny and reach targets, carrying out devastating bombing attacks which killed dozens and caused the Yishuv's morale to plummet. At the end of March, after several other victories, Abd al-Qadir arrived in Damascus for talks with the Arab League's military committee. While he was in Syria, however, the Haganah launched Operation Nahshon aimed at reopening the blocked road to Jerusalem. The Palmach attacked the village of Al-Qastal. For the first time in the civil war, the Zionists seized an Arab village without intending to withdraw.

Abd al-Qadir realized that this would destroy his main strategy: tightening the siege of Jerusalem until they surrendered. He drew on reports from the city's Jewish neighborhoods about a serious shortage of food and water, and believed that the capitulation of their residents was close at hand â a development that'd affect the course of the military campaign throughout the country. Yet, now, everything was at stake over a small village. According to the testimony, Abd al-Qadir was convinced that the village was the linchpin on which Palestine would rise or fall. He appealed to the representatives of the Arab governments for help.

&gt;""My plan is succeeding. We have reached a point where the Jews in Jerusalem are now asking for a hudna \[truce\], and we can bring about revisions in the partition plan. But you know that I will not be able to attack Jerusalem and hold Qastal with the Italian rifles I have and the antique ammunition that we brought from the Egyptian desert. Give me artillery and I will be able to force the Jews in Jerusalem to surrender.""

The Arab representatives rejected this request, not convinced of his ability to beat the Zionists. Once the Mandate terminated, the Arab representatives thought their own armies would intervene and triumph in that next stage of the war. That the Arab League had amassed weapons for the war effort, but was refusing to provide them to his forces, instead keeping them for the Arab Liberation Army and the regular Arab armies, enraged Abd al-Qadir. Once a Jewish state was declared, it was inevitable that the Zionists would receive massive reinforcements. Nothing was guaranteed, which is why he said they needed to intervene, NOW.

&gt;""Husayni and his people were caught between the Palestinian ethos and the Arab ethos. He understood that if the Arab forces were to come, their governance would also come. King Abdullah would rule here, and the Egyptians would rule in Gaza. They want help from Arabs but without paying the price. Give us money, but we will make the decisions â and to that the Arab countries did not agree.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Rubinstein describes the sarcasm of the Arab interlocutors: ""'Anyone would think Jerusalem is an important seaport,' Taha al-Hashemi, a senior Iraqi officer in the Army of Salvation, said. And, on another occasion, 'If we send Abdel-Kader artillery, what will happen is that the Jews will overcome the mujahideen \[guerrilla fighters\] and seize the cannons. Enough, enough, makho \[""no way,"" in Iraqi Arabic\] artillery, makho money, makho weapons.'""

Finally, Abd al-Qadir snapped at them:

&gt;""History will judge you for abandoning Palestine, you and those who are behind you I hold you responsible. I will capture Qastal and die, I and all my fighters, and history will record that you â criminals and traitors â abandoned the land."" After the meeting, he told his friends, who were waiting outside, ""We can go and have a good time in Iraq, or we can go back to Palestine and die for it â we will go back to Palestine.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of them apparently accepted the UN partition plan, others wanted to take part of Palestine for themselves â no one, however, thought it necessary to take the Palestinians themselves into account. Three days earlier, Fawzi al-Qawuqji, commander of the Arab Liberation Army, had met with a Haganah intelligence officer. The Jewish force wanted to be sure that he would not intervene on Husayni's side in the battles in the Jerusalem area. ""Udrubuhu \[smash him\],"" Qawuqji replied.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are many testimonies from those days describing Husayni's anger, sense of affront and feeling of betrayal, though some of them, Rubinstein points out, were written after his death. But the note that Husayni left the Arab League secretariat is authentic: ""I hold you responsible for leaving my soldiers in the field at the height of their victory without support or arms.""

[One part of this story is particularly surprising](https://imgur.com/a/wnSXB5x)

The Army of the Holy War would succeed in recapturing the village, albeit Abd al-Qadir was killed in the process. Rubinstein called the day of his death on April 8, 1948, the most disastrous day in the history of Arab Jerusalem and of the Palestinian people in the modern era. The Haganah would reoccupy Al-Qastal as Abd al-Qadir's demoralized men were attending his funeral.",Pro-Palestine

2) Because this is how you turn a 3d urban battleground, where traps, explosives, and defensible positions have already been established, into a much easier terrain to navigate an offensive over. To enable this, Israel has waited two weeks with a ground offensive, and still enables humanitarian corridors for civilians to flee, all the while shielding them from Hamas terrorists trying to keep them there. Any expectations exceeding this are absolutely delusional.

Gazan society is already radicalized as hell, it has already produced Hamas, the terror organization that as we speak holds 240 people hostage, and just a week ago murdered 1000+ civilians in their homes, to the glee and filmed celebrations of many Palestinians in Gaza, and in many other places around the world.

As soon as someone *reveres* a scholar, they stop thinking critically. Yikes. Who is it that worships this guy?

&gt; Israel's plan of genocide is clear 

Not really, no. They've killed far too many Hamas militants to be ""indiscriminately targeting"" people, and the extents to which Gaza have been ""flattened"" have been egregiously overstated by people. If the death toll ever starts increasing I might believe people, but it's been slowing down to a trickle over the last few months as Israel is clearly not actually trying to kill people en masse. Some out of context quotes don't prove the country is doing a genocide. Mearsheimer directly claims that Israel's been increasing their rate of killing and that's just factually and objectively the opposite of what's happening.

&gt;we in US know how controlled our Gov is by special interests

Sure, the ones that pay top dollar, when they go against the wishes of the American people, definitely.

&gt; Israel lobby AIPAC, 

They spent $26 million in our last election. Koch industries *alone* spent $28 million, part of the $200 million the oil industry spent. How about the finance industries $1,700 million? You think AIPAC and Israel tops anyone's list of concerns when other lobbies are shelling out 65 times as much money? It's pure delusion.

When has America done things for Israel that were against the wishes of the people of the country? Not just you and your online bubble, the actual electorate. What would look different about US policy if the ""Israel lobby"" wasn't active - or rather, what have their ""big wins"" been causing the US to do things that go against public opinion? 

&gt;MIC, arms dealers etc.

These industries basically spend no money on lobbying because a plurality of Americans when polled wish we spent more on them, and only a small minority thinks we spend too much, even if I am in that minority I can acknowledge parts of being in a democracy is the majority gets what they want. If we were cutting arms spending against the wishes of the masses, that would be the government bowing to a special interest group.

&gt;There are reasons that the ICJ South Africa just brought Israel up again bc of Rafah in front of the court.

Yes, follow the money, friend :) we all know why they're doing it and has nothing to do with principles or truth

&gt;And war cabinet member Benny Gantz is threatening to resign over this genocide strategy. 

It's over the *lack* of *any* strategy, which is the plainly obvious thing that's happening. Israel's been wildly thrashing at Gaza and its people in an attempt to get revenge. A tragedy? Absolutely! It doesn't have to be a genocide to be a tragedy, and calling it one cheapens the meaning the word genocide to being utterly meaningless.

&gt;Also you need to watch Mearsheimer, he always condemns Hamas [...] He clearly believes Hamas are bad.

I ended up watching the whole thing, at no point does he condemn them and if he made a single negative mark about them I somehow missed it because I came away with the understanding that at the absolute best he feels neutral about them - which is pretty messed up, to put it lightly. I'll admit I'm wrong if provided a timestamp, but I did not catch him saying a single bad word about Hamas. It's not a surprise, given how fast and loose he plays with facts and his wild speculations he presents as analysis. He somehow thinks Iran came out *ahead* in their little rocket fight with Israel, when they're the ones who literally ""got caught with their pants down"" by targeted strikes they had no defense for and couldn't see coming. The fact that the US and their neighbors came to their aid vs Iran was very obviously a loss for Iran, as it shows Israel's neighbors aren't going to turn on them that easily. It was proof Iran's a paper tiger without regional support outside their genocidal antisemitic proxies. As a foreign policy ""realist"" he should have been able to recognize this, rather than some nonsense about Israel being forced to ""only"" do a very targeted precise sucker punch.

Incidentally, Palestinians really need to say no to Iran and stop allying with people who want to purge the world of Jews like the Houthis. It didn't work out for them when they rescued thousands of actual war criminal Nazis from prosecution to come kill Jews for them in '48, and it's not going to work out for them now.

Second, Afghanistan is 1,000s of miles away from the US.  There was not a direct threat that a terrorists launching rockets would be hitting the US mainland.  That's not the case for Israel though.  Any Hamas terrorist remaining could pose a direct and imminent threat to the Israeli population.

1086,5/5/2024 19:33,"&gt;IDF sources have reported that areas were designated as kill zones (that were unspecified to civilians) meaning that anyone who stepped foot in them was considered a combatant (maybe this was not applied to women and small children in certain cases). If this is true, it would also mean that telling civilians to evacuate is also a good excuse to be able to kill anyone in the 'kill zones' as they had been warned.

Well, yeah. Israel gave a warning, weeks before the start of the ground operation for the civilians to evacuate to a specific area. 

If you don't evacuate out of your own volation, or you are stopped by Hamas it's not the responsibility of the IDF to ensure your safety, you were warned. 

You may claim that they didn't know, but it's evident that they do know, sometimes they are stopped by Hamas, and most times they specifically choose to delay their leave or not leave out of their own volition.

Another ""kumbaya soldier"", ""let's all be bestest fwends and eat cake with spwinkles"".......

&gt;In some circumstances it may be justified to not warn civilians before attacks if it's strategically necessary. But Israel seems to not warn civilians before strikes as well, the IDF only warns civilians before it invades entire areas. The IDF also tends to bomb civilians during the evacuation process; in fact in Rafah (and many other cases, this is just the most recent), the IDF bombed Rafah for days before giving evacuation plan. Another example of the IDF not warning civilians before a strike (for possibly 'tactical reasons'), the IDF certainly did not warn civilians before striking Al Mawassi, which Israel claims is the designated safe zone.

Just two days ago Hamas fired 10 short range missiles on the kerem shalom border crossing, from inside Rafah near the Rafah border, near a tent city, they killed 4 soldiers that were securing the area where the aid to Gaza is dropped.

The use of civilian/protected areas for military proposes make it a valid target according to humanitarian law, should Israel wait until they inform civilians from the rockets that were fired a couple hundred meters from them while more rockets are fired on Israel?

It's very well documented through well preserved sources like the Balfour Declaration, historical documents that clearly show no traces of Israel existing prior to 1948, historical documents and even film of zionist terrorism in the area, the plan dalet, memoirs and sayings by Israeli leaders who openly admit their crimes such as Golda Meir or Ben Gurion. It's also interesting how the majority of Israeli prime ministers changed their names (many of them had polish, Russian or Ukrainian names because they were never Palestinian but became Israeli after they stole the land and established their colony). 

Dude there are too many to list here.

1106,4/30/2024 20:59,"I keep hearing this kind of framing, as if Israel is capable of creating peaceful outcomes via unilateral actions ... peace takes two parties, one party can't just declare peace by itself.

&gt; Israel withdrew its settlers and military, and then closed the borders. It also has an agreement with Egypt regarding the entry of goods via Rafah. The airspace and coastal is completely controlled by Israel. 

The idea was that Israel would withdraw its settlers and military, and focus on border protection; the hope was that it would jumpstart the Oslo process, which had been stalled.

&gt; The question is: why didn't Israel mediate with the Gazans before this? 

Because ""the Gazans"" were politically part of Palestine at the time; they were governed by the Palestinian Authority, and Fatah was in power. Fatah is the party Israel had been negotiating with since the late 1980s.

Under the Oslo Accords (agreed between the PA and Israel in 1993), both parties would agree to peace terms within 10 years; at set intervals, Israel was supposed to withdraw settlers and troops from the territories both parties agreed to, and Oslo provided for a longer timeline (to be agreed upon later) for the relaxation of border restrictions, greater economic coordination, etc.

Unfortunately, Oslo destroyed a lot of the PA's authority with its base, many of whom did *not* want peace or recognition of Israel under any circumstances; see: the Second Intifada. Fatah never regained the credibility it had pre-Oslo, and was not only unable to stop Islamist groups (like Hamas and PIJ) from mounting terror attacks on Israel, it also was unable (or unwilling) to restart peace negotiations in any meaningful way.

As a result, Israel unilaterally took the next step *in the peace process both parties had already agreed to,* on the hope that the show of good faith would destroy the credibility of nationalist hard-liners on the Palestinian side. It did not do that.

&gt; Why didn't Israel do the same for the Gaza withdrawal? Mediation and a phased withdrawal? 

Again, Israel *did* do that; America provided the mediation (just as it did with Egypt), and both parties agreed to terms for a phased withdrawal (not only from Gaza, but from the West Bank). However, Egypt had a strong central government that was able to fulfill its treaty obligations, despite their (deep) unpopularity with many Egyptians... Palestine did not. Israel attempted to fulfil its treaty obligations anyway, but ultimately that only made the situation worse.",Neutral

A senior Israeli negotiator tells AFP that dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are certainly alive and that Israel cannot accept halting the war until all captives are released in a deal.

âDozens are alive with certainty,â the official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly on the issue.

âWe cannot leave them there a long time, they will die,â he says, adding that a vast majority of them are being held by Hamas terrorists.

The official says Israel cannot end the conflict with Hamas before a hostage deal because the terror group could âbreach their commitmentâ¦ and drag out the negotiations for 10 yearsâ or more.

âWe cannot, at this point in time â before signing the agreement â commit to ending the war,â the official says.

âBecause during the first phase, thereâs a clause that we hold negotiations about the second phase. The second phase is the release of the men and male soldier hostages.â

The official says the Israeli negotiating team had green-lit the Biden plan.

âWe expect, and are waiting for, Hamas to say âyes,'â the official says.

âIn the event we donât reach an agreement with Hamas, the IDF will continue to fight in the Gaza Strip in a no less intense fashion than itâs fighting now,â he says.

âIn a different manner, but an intense manner.â

This is not true at all.   
Now lets assume that Israel does commit genocide, therefore targets civilians. It's well known that Israel has been using very expensive missiles when attacking. It is also well known that Israel warns the civilians to evacuate before striking. Both of these procedures cost Israel alot of money, time, and most importantly might cost them the life of their soldiers. If they did intend to commit genocide, why wouldn't they use less expansive rockets, that cover more area without warning the civilians to evacuate and without wasting so much time allowing Hamas terrorists to escape? This is how war is handled in many other places but Israel wastes so many resources and puts human life on the line, that it does not make sense they commit genocide.

""There was Jews and Arabs living there in harmony previously""  
Also not true. There are many evidance that the native arabs attacked the native jews before the establishment of Israel.

""Â Is that a good enough reason to steal land and oppress people u don't deem worthy of going to ur heaven""  
Also not true. [The jews bought the land from the native arabs](https://lessons.myjli.com/survival/index.php/2017/03/26/land-ownership-in-palestine-1880-1948/). Later on, when Israel was established, the arab countries surrounding Israel started a war against Israel and lost. In the war, Israel has occupied tactical territories and kicked out threats (that's the cause of war).

""No matter what u say, it cannot justify the genocide happening there by Israel right now.""  
Proved no genocide.

""There is no narrative that deserves to have all those children bombed. All the civilians bombed. Targeted attacks on specific doctors homes who could help the civilians already screwed over by Israel.Â ""  
The specific doctors targeted are terrorists and have been proved to be. The civilians dying is because Hamas hides in their homes, schools, hospitals, and uses them as human shields (which again proves they think one of two thing; either it will sop Israel from killing them, or they try to make Israel bad and heartless killing all these people (in the arab religion, being a shahid in a holy war gets you to heaven)).

But by your logic when Hamas slaughtered babies and took them hostages - Israel had no other choice than what it is doing now.... So cope?

But Ahh yes the old myth that *Causing civilian casualties fighting Hamas will create more terrorists.*

U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Charles Brown warned Israel that prolonging the war in Gaza will drive more civilians to terrorism (Jacob Magid, âNew top American general says Israeli goal of toppling Hamas âa pretty large order,ââ Times of Israel, November 10, 2023).

Sadly, civilians are âcollateral damageâ in wars. Neither Israel nor any other army can base its operations on how they will react. The Allies did not concern themselves with whether more German civilians would be motivated to become Nazis after the firebombing of Dresden. The war on terror waged by the United States since 9/11 has resulted in many civilian casualties. Still, war planners have not been deterred by the possibility that more people will join ISIS or al-Qaeda. President Barack Obama didnât halt drone strikes against terrorists because hundreds of civilians were mistakenly killed.

Israel takes measures no other army does to protect civilians while Hamas uses them as shields. For most of the world, it is a tragedy that thousands have died (the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry figures cannot be trusted as they do not identify Hamas terrorists among the casualties and exaggerate fatalities). However, Hamas uses people as cannon fodder and their deaths as propaganda instruments. Gaza families should blame the terrorists who built tunnels for themselves instead of shelters, but some may seek revenge against Israel. Does that mean Israel shouldnât destroy Hamas to protect its citizens?

Brown and many other Western officials donât acknowledge that Israel is part of the Middle East, not the Middle West. Israelis know Hamas is just one enemy. Iran and its proxies want to kill Jews and will not be satisfied until Israel is destroyed. That will be true no matter how many Gazans die.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others think the âmoderateâ Palestinians in the West Bank have a different agenda because they refuse to believe that Palestinians mean what they say and teach. When they chant, âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine must be free,â it is a call for genocide. When their textbook maps show all of Israel as Palestine, they want their children to believe Israel does not and should not exist. When Mahmoud Abbas calls on Palestinians to defend the al-Aqsa Mosque against fictitious Jewish raiders, he is perpetuating the Islamist lie that it is in danger. When Blinken naively talks about a two-state solution, he ignores the Palestiniansâ repeated rejection of the idea before a single Gazan died.

The Palestinians trace their grievance to the 1917 Balfour Declaration and engaged in terrorism for three decades before the partition resolution. They consider the establishment of a Jewish state in 1948 the Nakba (âcatastropheâ), not the capture of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967. Palestinian fedayeen began attacking Israel from Gaza in the 1950s when Egypt occupied it. The PLO was created in 1964, three years before the Israeli âoccupationâ of the disputed territories. Hamas began bombarding Israel with rockets after every Israeli left Gaza, squandering the opportunity to build the infrastructure for a state.

Hamas must be eliminated as a threat. Whether more Palestinians decide to become terrorists is out of Israelâs control. They will be a danger for Israel but would only compound the tragedy for the Palestinians by ensuring no Israeli government will agree to another Hamastan on its border.",Pro-Israel

1144,4/18/2024 19:40,"oddly enough, it was from Al Jazeera, they were trying to insinuate that israel calling the civilians as ""human shields"" was to legitimize civilian casualties.

even though it is clearly what hamas is doing when they brought the hostages back to gaza instead of staying and fighting in israel, so they can capitalize on their tunnels that they built all these years under civilian sites like schools, hospitals, residential areas, etc..

Al Jazeera is based in Qatar, who are hosting the hamas leaders in their posh hotels, and i am using their own argument against them.

calling out IDF's usage of the term, doesn't negate that hamas IS actually using the civilians as human shields.

each time IDF warns civilians to evacuate, a portion of hamas (the ones holding the hostages) are using the civilians as camouflage. 

in fact, IDF rescued a couple of hostages in RAFAH (where the civilians evacuated), the hostages was being held captive in the home of a ""civilian"" family. 

even UNRWA officials had already been caught red handed as having participated on oct 7 massacre and kidnapping of civilians.

1145,4/18/2024 14:11,"my bad, i missed the part where you referred to them as militants. i thought you were completely denying that they were members. 
but this logic is still flawed. 
you cannot say that israel commit a war crime by killing 3 confirmed terrorists and not say the same thing about hamas killing 1,200 civilians. hamas has broken too many international laws to count, and continues to do so with their unlawful abduction, cruel treatment, and murdering of civilian hostages, as well as their use of human shields. 
what israel did was a targeted killing, which can violate the right to life, but in this case it is completely legal. the morality and application of international law with the targeted killing policy is questioned, but nevertheless it is legal in israelâs war against hamas.

âThe Court held that for a targeted killing to be legal, it must satisfy four conditions:

(1) The State must have strong evidence that the potential target meets the conditions of having lost their protected status;
(2) If less drastic measures can be used to stop the potential target posing a security threat, such as arrest, the State must use them, unless this alternative poses too great a risk to the lives of its soldiers;
(3) An independent and thorough investigation must be conducted immediately after the operation to determine whether it was justified. In appropriate cases, the State should compensate innocent civilians for harm done;
(4) The State must assess in advance whether the expected collateral damage to innocent civilians involved in a targeted killing is greater than the anticipated military advantage to be gained by the operation. If it is, the State must not carry out the operation.â

http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbJIL/2007/21.html#Heading84

there is plenty of evidence that the 3 men were terrorists who undoubtedly lost their civilian protection status. 
you could argue that the IDF did not attempt to arrest the men first. but itâs also arguable that if the men were merely arrested and not killed, hamas would use the hostages to demand their return. but we are also unaware of how the operation went down, and whether the terrorists posed a threat at that moment. hospital staff claimed the men were sleeping when they were killed, but they have an obvious bias as people who were knowingly caring for hamas terrorists and allowing them to hide out in the hospital, so anything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. whether or not they posed a threat to the soldiers at that moment, the IDF claims to have evidence that they were planning an imminent attack, which made them an imminent threat. 

if you can prove that those 3 werenât planning a terrorist attack, you might have a valid argument. otherwise, israel reserves the right to attack with lethal force against a foreseeable threat to the life of the nation. israel is not going to release classified evidence for reasons i shouldnât need to explain, and hamas of course isnât gonna just come out and admit to plotting another attack. the only evidence you should need is october 7th. we shouldnât need to wait for another massacre to happen to prove to you what israel did is necessary. if a new case was brought is brought against them for this situation, iâm sure israel would be able to provide sufficient evidence. but why on earth would they release sensitive information that could endanger lives and military operations to the public? 

and why do you not expect hamas to face repercussions for the war crimes theyâve unarguably commit? why are you so focused on israel committing a war crime against 3 terrorists who got exactly what was coming to them? they were committing a war crime just by being in a civilian hospital. these 3 men have committed violent crimes against innocent people and were planning to commit more, and youâre more concerned that israel could have possibly commit a war crime depending on how you interpret the law.",Pro-Israel

In some circumstances it may be justified to not warn civilians before attacks if it's strategically necessary. But Israel seems to not warn civilians before strikes as well, the IDF only warns civilians before it invades entire areas. The IDF also tends to bomb civilians during the evacuation process; in fact in Rafah (and many other cases, this is just the most recent), the IDF bombed Rafah for days before giving evacuation plan.

Actually harden their side of the border with Gaza instead of leaning on Likud's strategy of intimidation and technology. A better prepared Israel would never have had Oct 6 happen.

Stop needlessly escalating by allowing Likud to send settlers into the West Bank. All it does it erode any openness Palestinians may have to working with Israel. Until that happens, it's pretty hard to convince anyone paying attention that Likud doesn't have expansionist motives in Gaza, especially given statements from senior officials of the party.

Maybe work with their last ally who desperately wants them to work with the Palestinians and find a path out of the conflict and toward a stable solution that includes the Arabs.

None of those necessitate an invasion of Rafah, rather the opposite. Idk what kind of ""security"" Bibi and Likud are after, but undoing all of Israel's foreign relations work over the last 70 years in 6 months isn't security. Destabilizing the region won't make Israel more secure. Going to war with Egypt and Syria again won't make Israel more secure.

&gt;The US/UK alliance let the Israelites train after war on German military training grounds.

Nope, to the contrary, Britain's war against Zionism was already international. In July 1947, police in France uncovered and confiscated an arms dump belonging to the Irgun ([here's proof, right from the newspapers](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitstimes19470709-1.2.8)). Not like the training would've mattered anyway, since immigration from the British and American occupation zones were restricted ([here's proof, directly from the newspapers](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19480930&amp;id=EBQqAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=799,4159053)). The only ""training"" which the Zionists received was from fighting in World War II and by illegally training amongst themselves. The British killed dozens of Zionist terrorists between 1945 and 1947, interned hundreds of other terrorists in East Africa, and interned tens of thousands of illegal immigrants in Cyprus. Even during the civil war for Mandatory Palestine, they continued to get into small skirmishes with the Zionists. Truman didn't care that much about Israel and mainly wanted votes. Multiple American Zionists who violated the embargo and illegally smuggled surplus bomber planes to Israel were put on trial for violating the Neutrality Act.

As many as 200 British soldiers and colonial police officers felt so passionately about they outright deserted to fight in the civil war for Mandatory Palestine ([source for this](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/135106/10/British%20Army%20and%20Police%20Deserters%20and%20the%20Arab%20v4%20July%20CC%20highlighting%20removed.pdf)). When I first read about this, I found it hard to believe. Nobody could be that fucking based.

&gt;British personnel became polarized by the violence of the insurgency and its consequences of restricting their movements in Palestine. This often resulted in resentment towards the Yishuv and a degree of sympathy for the Arabs. The evidence suggests that most pro-Arab deserters were extreme cases of the general attitude of British personnel.

But no, they renounced racism, became based, and joined the Palestinians in armed struggle against the Zionists:

&gt;""I could not stomach the way the Arabs who should really own this country are being treated by not only the UN but by the government in Palestine,"" a man who went by the name of Frank told a Chicago Tribune journalist in May 1948. Frank had been stationed in British Mandate Palestine as part of the British Army and, having made the decision to desert his post, contacted the Arab underground forces stationed in the country.

&gt;""â¦ I made my protest with the only thing that mattered to me â my career.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Just over 12 hours later, Frank had joined Jaysh Al-Inqadh (the Arab Liberation Army).

1205,3/27/2024 1:50,"I think that pragmatically, the biggest issue is the notion of a temporary ceasefire, and limited reassurance that Israel won't resume the attacks once the hostages have been returned. I doubt that some criticism from influencers and whatnot is going to stop the Hamas leadership wanting some sort of guarantee that Israel's retaliation over 10/7 is a done deal as long as they stop lobbing rockets (\*), especially given the rhetoric on the Israel's side (\*\*), just like none of the international criticism has stopped Israel from making a move into Rafah. Both sides will still do what they believe is in their best interest.

(\*) I'd like to think that the Hamas would have more sense than to break the cease fire from their end, but I am not crediting them that as a given. If they do, then all bets are off.

(\*\*) I have seen you argue that Binken said that Israel has agreed to the terms of the cease fire, and claim that Netanyahu's rhetoric is just to placate the right of the government. But honestly, between Biken's words and Netanyahu' word, I am still more inclined to take Netanyahu's as more representative to Israel's intent. I think Binken might well be projecting what the US would like, and the US has a lot of urgency to push for peace, and get Biden a win on his handling of the conflict before the US election. Yet push come to shove, if Israel was to resume their hunt for the Hamas in Gaza once the hostages are back, this time without fear of accidentally harming the hostages, what is the worst that is going to happen? Some international criticism, some more protests perhaps, things that never stopped Israel before. Understandably, no one is going to come to the aid of a designated terrorist organisation.

Setting aside what one might think the Hamas deserves, pragmatically, we need to think a little bit about whether any proposal address their concerns.

4. Russia is a sovereign state, remember this fact. Russia have political motives for their invasion, it doesnât makes it justified but it also challenges labeling them as terrorists.

Also, we have the Washington Institute, a pro-Israel lobby group...

https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/gaza-fatality-data-has-become-completely-unreliable

They use the ""central collection system"", which they trust, a list of identified people killed in Gaza, giving a total death toll of 17,571 by March 18, including **5,124 women** and **5,040 children** (note: this isn't the total death toll, but identified dead, so the numbers of women and children, nevertheless this pro-Israel lobby group agree that **10,174** women and children were killed by March 18). 

https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/decline-overall-fatalities-POL3851-fig3.jpg

However, they use this data to dispute the claim that 72% of deaths are women and children. Their statistical analysis shows the proportion of women and children, killed since Nov 3, was 48%. They also show the proportion of women and children killed shows a gradual decline over time. 

They contrast this with media reports, daily reports of people killed, with these offical figures. This analysis showed that media reports consistently inflate the numbers of women and children killed.

Essentially, the article shows huge casualties during the early air campaign phase of the war, with a high proportion of women and children killed, but the proportion of women and children killed decresed as the war shifted to a ground offensive.

&gt;In addition to the MOHâs growing reliance on the media reports methodology, these trends may reflect various factors on the ground, such as Israelâs shift from a primarily air-based campaign to ground fighting, the mass evacuation of civilians from the north to Rafah governorate, and the decreasing intensity of fighting in areas where the central collection system is still functioning. Such factors would be expected to reduce overall civilian casualties and therefore increase the proportion of adult men killed, since that is the demographic most likely to serve as combatants

And 

&gt;government officials need to be aware that the actual overall death toll may be significantly higher (or, less likely, lower) than what the MOH has reported. 

So I'm not seeing evidence of a substantially lower death toll, of under 10,000 killed, with most of them Hamas.",Neutral

1221,3/22/2024 15:37,"You seem to not know the actual historical background so let me fix that for you. In 1850 Palestine was populated by Arabs, 400,000 (80%) Muslims, 75,000 Christians, 25,000 Jews and a small Druze population. For centuries they had lived in harmony. In the late 1800s, in response to discrimination and violence against them some European Jews decided to establish a Jewish state and investigated a number of different countries before choosing Palestine. These colonisers became known as Zionists.

This initial influx of small numbers of Zionists into Palestine created no problems. As more and more Zionists arrived â many with the express intention of establishing a Jewish state â the indigenous population became alarmed. This is what eventually gave rise to escalating waves of violence, the indigenous population's fear that their land and homes would be forcibly taken from them, which turned out to be a legitimate fear.

After World War II the UN, dominated by the USA and the UK, recommended partitioning Palestine. Although Jews constituted only one-third of the population and owned less than 7% of the land, the UN recommended ceding 56% of Palestinian land to a Jewish state, against the wishes of the indigenous Palestinian majority. In November 1947 the UN General Assembly passed its partition resolution. 

In March 1948, Zionist terrorists began a pre-planned, brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing forcing Palestinians from their land in order to create a Jewish majority. Over 750,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes, farms and villages by Zionist terrorists â 250,000 of them BEFORE the declaration of the state of Israel â and became refugees.

There's the background historical context that has lead to this. As for the two-state solution, don't be stupid and act like Israel ever had any intention of giving Palestinians autonomy. The complete seizure of Palestinian land and ethnic cleansing of the native population was the plan from the beginning. You should look up ""Greater Israel"", they dont just want all of Palestine, they want pieces of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt too. If they really did support a two-state solution, they never would have continued establishing illegal settlements in the West Bank, demolishing entire Palestinian towns and villages and forcing them to flee. 

Almost a century of this shit is what created Hamas, what made an event like Oct. 7th inevitable. I'm not gonna justify the actions of Hamas, but I'm not gonna say that I was surprised by it. Occupation breeds violent resistance every single time, there is not a single point in history where this has not been the case.  

And still, absolutey NONE of what you said justifies Israel's actions in the West Bank or Gaza. But I'm wasting my time with you, amn't I? You seem to already be dead set on the fucked up idea that the Palestinians deserve to be oppressed, displaced and exterminated.",Pro-Palestine

1223,3/22/2024 14:04,"You do know Hamas plan is to completely destroy Israel right?

In fact, it's in their original charter since 1988 and they literally tried doing the same thing since they were elected in 2007 (the war of 2008-2009,2012, 2014, 2021, etc...).

And in case you forgot, the reason they could be elected in the first place in democratic elections what that Israel gave the Palestinians Gaza (a territory that belonged to Israel, and not because they took it from the Palestinians or other forms of propaganda because Egypt controlled the territory before Israel) for free not asking for anything in return, and the Palestinians elected Hamas despite knowing about its plans.

And if Israel was indeed evil like you claim, they wouldn't have waited for the terrible massacre of October 7th to attack. Like I mentioned earlier Hamas started wars in Israel more than enough times and Israel could use any of those wars as a reason to destroy Hamas.

But they only did so once Hamas launched a massive terror attack that cost thousands of lives, hundreds of hostages, raped women and broken families. But notice that while the numbers are lower, they are worse because Hamas wasn't forced to go on a war, they broke an existing ceasefire deal and entered Israel doing everything not from far away but with guns and seeing the people they killed. All filmed by their own go-pros...

You could call Israel evil as much as you want but facts talk louder than propaganda, and so far Israel did ton of stuff to help the population of Gaza survive this war.

\* They evacuated them on day 1 to Rafah so they wouldn't be hit while Israel scanned the rest of Gaza.

\* Israel itself provides Gaza water, electricity and oil.

\* Israel allows international aid to enter Gaza, which is something they do not have to do.

\* Israel attempted to evacuate some of the population outside of Gaza through the Rafah crossing but Egypt closed it.

\* Israel also worked on an international plan leaded by the previous prime minister of the UK to move Gazans to countries that accept taking them.

And in general throughout the whole war the main leadership of Israel - Israel's prime minister, Israel's minister of defense and the 3rd member of the war Cabinet ex-chief of staff and the leader of the national unity party all claimed their main goal is not to kill civilians but to get rid of Hamas.

An organization btw that not only attacks Israel but also hurt their own population by using them as human shields (building tunnels underneath populated areas), stealing from them and in general leaded them to poverty and weakness by taking the territory they got from Israel and instead of creating a prospering beach country, created a terrible terror state.

So yes, Israel does kill more Palestinians because Israel actually has technology and actually cares about other stuff than just destroying their enemies. But when you look at the goals of each side and what each side does for its population.

It's pretty clear one deserved being considered a terror organization by majority of the western countries around the world while the other is a victim of a radical terror organization that grows new generations of terrorists, teaching them about sacrificing themselves from a very young age.

Have a read on the Nakba and see what Zionist terrorists groups like Lehi, Irgun and Palmach did to the Palestinian people in the 1940s. There were numerous massacres involving acts like parading and executing prisoners, rape, infanticide, immolation, locking people in a house and blowing it up. Everything Hamas is alleged to have done on Oct 7th, Israel has done to Palestinians over decades! 

The only difference? All those Zionist terrorists that raped and murdered throughout the holy land were absolved of their crimes and absorbed into Israeli society, mainly the IDF. There were numerous massacres in the months following the formation of Israel and the IDF, mostly by battalions populated with former terrorists. The Irgun itself transformed into the political party Herut, which then evolved into the Likud party, Netanyahuâs party and the leading party of the current Israeli coalition.

Not so much...

And, let's look a little further back...  at a time, Egypt referred to the region as Peleset, we would know it as Canaan...  It was invaded and conquered...  By the Hebrew tribe...  And so, native Palestinians, Canaanites, became victims.

Then, in 1945, seeds planted in 1890s or earlier grew, when the foreign zionist terrorist militias, menachem begins likud/irgun, the lehi, and haganah, launched ""Plan Aleph"", the start of their war against Palestine.

So, again, in 1945 Palestinians became victims.

In 1956 iirc, israel invaded Gaza and Egypt.  Again, Palestinians became victims.

In 1967, again, israel launched another invasion of Gaza and egypt.  Again, Palestinians became victims.

israel's invaded Gaza several times, again, Palestinians become victims.

But, generally, when violent european terrorists stole their country is kind of the headline answer.

Zionists raped and slaughtered native Palestinians, they rape and slaughter native Palestinians today.

If you wonder why the Palestinian Authority is less supported, it's because it was basically created by israel and the US to be losers, as a collaborator government, to basically betray their people for the benefit of israel and the US.

So, the Palestinian Authority basically never delivers the Palestinian people anything they really want because, as a creation of, a creature of israel and the US, it doesn't serve the Palestinian people, it mostly serves israel and the US.  So naturally, it never really has much support.  The irony being how israel supported from the beginning to today, Hamas, for the specific purpose of undermining peace and undermining the Palestinian Authority.

israel has always wanted Palestine to be weak, and encouraged infighting among Palestinians.

&gt;Why can't they just co-exist and make peace?

Let's say the British come to India...  India is rich in spices, it also has a large population, Britain wants both these things, Indias Spices, and it's labor, and also Indian land...

So Britain takes it.

The British are cruel to Indians, they kill Indians, they steal from Indians, they rob Indians of their land...

Why can't the Indians just co-exist and make peace with the British?

Foreign zionists come to Palestine...  These foreign zionists come to learn a new invented language, new hebrew, one they're creating at the same time they're learning it for the first time.  They take native Palestinian land, through land fraud, through the tower and stockade movement, through violent ethnic cleansing...

They were violent crusaders there to create a Jewish nation in Palestine against the wishes of the native Palestinians.

Hamas sezied power because THEY WON THE ELECTION IN GAZA 
AND Israel has left Gaza so the Palestinian can govern themselves.

So your point now that Israel should've stayed? Comon man, this is not a serious argument. 

&gt;. The idea that Israel is going to withdraw from Palestine and them immediately allow it to import missiles and artillery is a simple strawman.

No it's not, have you heared about Irans plan?  
Look at Hezbollah, how can you justify this. 
This is what going to happen in the West bank if Israel leaves. 


&gt; It was separated becasue the international boundary was actually older than the majority of the city.

Nah man, that was when Egypt decided they don't want to deal with Gaza: 

&gt;When Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982, Rafah was split into a Gazan part and an Egyptian part,


&gt;Beyond that, what would a federated system look like? Federated with whom? Clearly not Israel. I don't really see how this could work. Local elections would quickly be captured by the established political parties. In the end the local leadership would end up subordinated to a party leadership anyway.

This is one of the most pragmatic solutions while the ""1ss"" ""2ss"" solutions are not pragmatic and cannot work atm. 
As I showen above we tried that already, Gaza was a free state to rule however they want, THEY elected Hamas - a Muslim sunni brotherhood organization that began as a charity group. Gaza is 99% sunni Islam, then what can you expect, they want Sharia law.

Don't know how well you know how refugees are treated once they escape the battlefield, but usually it's a bus ticket, maybe some money and a ""good luck"". 

No country assured this. 

&gt;Itâs better than bombing buildings that may or may not be full of civilians.

Israel does everything in their power to evacuate them prior to the bombings, if they decide or are unable to leave because Hamas forces them to stay, or they are too stubborn to leave or are disabled and left by their community that is a tragedy, but it is not the responsibility of Israel.

It's the fault of Hamas

1. yes, that would be excellent. The evacuation of women and children from the combat zone is what any state does first. And Israel begged Egypt to host refugees from Gaza. Egypt only strengthened the border and sent an army with tanks to guard it. It is clear that Israel cannot accept refugees from Gaza on its territory. but not a single Arab country is ready to accept even one refugee from Gaza. and Hamas continues to use them as human shields.

2. Why shouldn't they exist? Arab villages exist on Israel territory. Building in C zone is legal by Oslo accords. Does future palestine state wants to be no-jew zone?
Remember,  that all the jews were expelled from WB , when Jordan annexed it. 

While I am against settlers occupying or destroying palestinian homes, of course. 

3. OK, why not. 
4. Partly, Israel is responsible by not stopping hamas 15 years earlier. Israel left Gaza in 2005, in good faith , with hope, that palestinians will create a state they so much desire. 
All this years,  Israel thought that while hamas steals most of aid money, it's leaders were billionaires in Qatar, and everybody seemed to be ok with it. 

5. For now, I think Israel shouldn't have left Gaza. It should maintain control, so many gazans now will live , and have much nicer lifes.

1273,3/4/2024 9:21,"There will inevitably be an instance where someone hand wrings over the suicide bombings of Hamas (and other resistance factions that used this tactic) and even this has a fairly nuanced explaination.

Hamas is not a monolith. There were those within the organization which strongly opposed suicide bombings and those that were in strong favor of using ANY means necessary to deal damage to the Zionist entity. It was the Zionist terror squads that escalated the Second Intifada by killing Palestinians first and later imposing a chokehold siege on the West Bank enclaves and Gaza. The Zionists created the suffocating conditions that pushed Palestinians over the edge and some believed that had nothing more to lose aside from their own lives. The undermining of the Oslo Accords (both at inception and during the 90s) and false hope of a negotiated solution that never came to be also contributed to the despair.

It is noteworthy that all resistance factions discontinued suicide bombings after the Second Intifada. Not only did these operations degrade the ranks of trained fighters at a time where the factions were in for a protracted war against the Zionists, such operations did not help the reputation of the Palestinian movement globally when the ""War on Terror"" had just commenced. It was Palestinians that decided suicide bombings were not the way to go moving forward by recognizing that they were counterproductive and they have since maintained discontinuation of this tactic.

Condemnations of Palestinian suicide bombings are usually coming from those with an interest in undermining the Palestinian liberation movement while giving a free pass to the repression the Zionists imposed before, during, and the after the Second Intifada. Thus, if one feels the need to condemn Palestinian suicide bombings, they should condemn the actions of Zionists that led to that outcome thousand times over. Otherwise, exclusive condemnation of Palestinians is nothing but politically motivated hypocrisy.

If asked to condemn the suicide bombings, simply reverse the question to request a condemnation on Zionist terrorism. They were killing Palestinians before the PLO, Hamas, and suicide bombings were a thing. Loaded questions should not be entertained with a simple yes/no answer. Give the inquirer and audience something to think about rather than giving them the satisfaction of ""exposing a terrorism supporter"".",Pro-Palestine

In fact most definitions of Palestine's territory simply refer to ""occupied Palestine"" but since occupation of Palestine itself is in question it really doesn't tell us what the State of Palestine's boundaries actually are. 

That's not true. UN General Assembly Resolution 58/292 and UN General Assembly Resolution 67/19 affirmed Palestine's territories as those territories occupied by Israel during the 1967 War which would include the West Bank. This would in turn be an approval of the Green Line, an armistice line set up after the 1948 War, which is the basis for the borders of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank today. The Green Line is the de facto basis for Israel's current borders which simultaneously is also the basis for Palestine's borders. 

Literally the territory when you hear ""Israel"" corresponds to this demarcation line. The problem is Israel violates this line by continuing settlements and occupation of the West Bank.

 *Reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to* *self-determination* *and to independence in their State of Palestine on the* ***Palestinian territory occupied since 1967*** 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_Nations\_General\_Assembly\_resolution\_67/19#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution_67/19#)

There are only two Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although Israel de jure withdrew from Gaza in 2005 (even that it's disputed, many still claim Israel practices a de facto occupation of Gaza), the West Bank is both considered to be under de jure and de facto Israel occupation.

**And of course, Israel rejected both resolutions outright**

Plus, the UN has already voted that Israel must withdraw from all territory conquered in 1967 through UN Security Council Resolution 242. Thus, Israel by still controlling and occupying the West Bank would be in violation of this security resolution.

Thereâs clearly a split in Israel - those who believe bringing home the hostages is a priority and those who believe destroying Hamas is priority at the expense of the hostages (and Palestinian civilians).

Itâs worth pointing out how greatly out of touch the second group is - the USA believes they have no credible plan to destroy Hamas and strongly oppose the invasion, the areas supposedly already cleared still have Hamas fighters.

For example, you mention historic examples and requirements to warn civilians of bombardments.  You fail to consider what this would practically mean in an age of smooth bore cannons and howitzers (which was the state of the art in 1862).  It seems relatively clear to me the idea of a warning in that context would encompass a broad area and it would be discharged through something pretty banal like telling all the people in Rafah to get out because it's going to be subject to bombardment as opposed to anything more specific (such as warning people their apartment building specifically is going to be blown up).

It also seems to me you switch standards between some notion of general practice and (unsourced) claims about international humanitarian law.  The general practice answer would sort of require an inquest about how much effort a country like e.g. Russia took to warn civilians before launching rockets at  Kyiv (it would seem the answer is no effort) or the US before bombing parts of Mosul during the war on ISIS (possibly also very little effort?).  

The legal claims could be supported if you read international treaties - for example to support the claim below:

&gt;Firstly, warning civilians before an attack is just International Law.

You would ideally provide a citation to a presently governing treaty such as one of the Geneva Conventions or the Rome Statute.  Absent such a citation, I am left wondering why you think it is a requirement at all.",Neutral

Imagine an old school fortified castle with multiple defensible stations.Â  For all their training and weaponry, the IDF would be slaughtered (while still doing massive damage) if they rushed Rafah. Urban warfare is a massive defensive benefit, where every room can house the enemy and if you don't clear them one by one, you're giving the enemy a clear shot at your rear. And this doesn't even include the tunnels and bunkers that Hamas has constructed.Â 


Â Carpet bombing won't do much either except to slaughter innocents because of the aforementioned bunkers and tunnels, so the IDF won't do that.Â Â 


Â So, the IDF only has two options that lead to victory.Â Â 


Â One, they could use the same option that the USA used to avoid entrenched urban warfare in WW2 and nuke Rafah. Obviously, that's not an option.Â Â 


Â Two, they need to engage in siege warfare and cut the city apart piece by piece. They'll set up a perimeter around a targeted section, then try to evacuate as many noncombatants as possible. Then they'll start closing in, attacking Hamas positions while continuing to evacuate noncombatants until they take the whole section.Â Â 


Â This is all lengthy and exhausting for the troops, so the IDF will have to rotate them out constantly to maintain combat effectiveness. Proceeding too quickly will lead to physical and mental fatigue that will lead to more IDF and noncombatant deaths, which the IDF is trying to minimize. Also, waiting in siege warfare is a massive benefit to the attacker. Hamas doesn't know when the attacks will start, so they have to stay on operational alert constantly, increasing stress, fear, and fatigue.Â 


Â We've seen this strategy on a smaller scale when the IDF has cleared out hospital complexes. The IDF has processed methodically, taking days to secure what amounts to a city block.Â 


Â Also, Israel is still surrounded by forces that would gladly attack if the IDF was perceived to be weakened by the advance in Gaza. So they have to maintain the ability to quickly move forces and resources to their other borders while still keeping a secure perimeter in Gaza.",Pro-Palestine

As such, the terrorists had to provoke them first before they started taking the gloves off. Add this with the Holocaust, and the photos of British troops beating the shit out of Holocaust survivors who were violently resisting orders to be deported from Palestine didn't look very good to those with no context.

As a ceasefire is by definition a mutual agreement to stop hostilities or the unconditional decision to stop hostilities by one of the parties (neither of which apply here), wouldn't it be more accurate to title the article ""Israel Begins Rafah Strikes After Hamas Proposes Counteroffer""?

As it currently stands, the title will likely mislead readers into believing that there was a ceasefire and that it was broken by Israel.",Neutral

Israel packing up their country isn't a logical outcome - but they did make the Palestinians spread across the land pack up and condense into the Gaza strip and now they're pushing them to the border. How is that okay?

The thing is, and the only thing of importance, is that Israel stops the genocide it's doing right now. Everything else comes second. They can go back to 1967 borders and send special forces to deal with Hamas when needed.

The premise of your ""open air argument"" is false. Neither Palestinians nor Hamas want to kill all Jews. With that correction, of your statement, yes the open air prison is a heinous war crime.

Based on everything I've read, I don't see much difference between what Hamas does and what Israel does. They break their agreements and shoot rockets. Except Hamas terrorist works with pipes while Israel has the strongest military in the world that is.....fighting children?

I think Egypt has done wrong as has the Arab League and the Palestinians. But again, I think Israel and the messianic Kahanists and Likud Jewish supremacist one-staters areÂ just as big of a problemÂ as Hamas, which I and my country regard as an absolutist terroristic organization that has no role in the future of our region."" i very much agree with you on all of these points and my percentages are rounded estimates to illustrate proportional responsibility if not exact amount. Regarding your hint about what happened after WW1, I don't think the Treaty of Versailles justifies what Germany ended up doing in WW2 in any way, shape, or form. I also don't think the Shoah canÂ justifyÂ the Nakba. I don't think the Nakba can justify the Arabs forcibly kicking out of their native Jewish populations. I also don't think the occupation justifies what Hamas did on October 7 and I don't think October 7 justifies what Israel has been doing since October 8. Justification is a very strong word and justice is actually pretty simple to calculate.

while it does not justify what Germany did, my point is that it does not work. placing all the blame one actor breaks the system and invites worse actors. See Likud, they gain power because egypt, the palestinians, and the arab league put all the blame on israel. They are awful, but they are the consequence of the reaction to resisting collapse. The German N\*\*s were awful people, but they did fix the economy and restabilized the country. So Egypt, the palestinians, and the arab league need to take a lesson from history and resolved this by helping dismantle Likud and changing the system not by destroying israel.

&gt;Israel has been occupying land since 1967, forbidding the people on that land from determination or a life of dignity while allowing hundreds of thousands of settlers to move in. You're an Israeli in the US. You can't vote in the Israeli elections unless you're a diplomat because you're overseas and not in Israel. Yet a settler in Beit El can vote for Bibi and Ben Gvir? Is Beit El Israel? Why do they get to vote and Ramallah residents 10 km away don't? That doesn't seem like a just or fair system.Â 

yes, i very much agree with this assessment and where before it didnt matter that much to me, it has become imperatively apparent that i should vote and i am looking at all my options. the main reason they give though is that i dont pay israeli taxes,

but considering the fact that by the laws of israel and common sense i dont pay taxes it somehow excludes me.

the general fear is that israelis abroad tend to be more conservative so the left blocks attempts to provide the right, though personally i think they are about even. the main difference between me and a person who lives in the west bank is that they can drive to vote and i have to take a plane.

&gt;That seems like the absolutist Jewish one-staters have taken over the government and are slowly wanting to take over all the land (like the Likud charter states) while kicking out the people or making their lives so miserable they leave...for Egypt or elsewhere. Why would we help with that? Why would we help make that happen?

i never said help with it, i said do something other than place responsibility on israel. also maybe add support for Yesh Atid, who are more willing to resolve the situation and seek among other things to give the palestinians their state. but since it is israels responsibility it means you as a state are not actually doing anything.

&gt;Egypt is not primarily responsible for Gaza or Palestine. Israel is considered the occupying power by almost every country in the world, including the one you reside in. There's absolutely a place for Israel in the region and it should exist and be supported and made safe. If there was a Palestinian state, I would support the Egyptian army itself coming to Israel's side if Iran or anyone else was stupid enough to try and attack. The Jews are native to this part of the world. They should stay and be welcomed and feel safe and secure.

i appreciate you acknowledging that fact. and i never denied that israel is the occupying power. no one is denying that. prior to oct7 israel didnt occupy gaza, but now it is. and it seems like Bibi wants to again, an idea i think incredibly stupid. personally i think they should ask the saudi's to garantee the safety and fight terrorism in gaza as a prelude to a proper palestinian state.

&gt;But that doesn't in any way shape or form justify what Israel is doing and has been doing to the Palestinians in Gaza or the West Bank. Somehow shifting all that blame or responsibility onto Egypt is something most would find absurd.

as i said Egypt is not wholly responsible, but they are in part responsible. and while there is not justification for what israel has done in gaza, the destruction of hamas is necessary, though i do not think attacking Rafah will add anything. if i was in charge. i would fix northern gaza and slowly move people out of the south there if i really felt that hamas is there and needs to be destroyed. it was necessary to push people south for their safety, and now it is necessary to make sure they are safe in the north, and a mostly destroyed place is not viable to move people to.",Pro-Palestine

&gt; 4. Everything done and being accused of being done by Hamas has been done by early Zionist terror groups like Lehi, Irgun, and lesser degree Haganah. Yep, including using hospitals, SA, beheading, all of it.

Youâre falling for the typical, slanderous, Arab smear campaign of Israel hook, line, and sinker. This was written by the [AHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Higher_Committee), whose leader was someone named [Hajj Amin Al-Husseini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_al-Husseini), and was published by the Arab League who began a genocidal war against Jews. Once you read up on these parties, their leaders, and their politics, youâll understand how youâve been duped. Iâd recommend you be more cognizant about what sources you are believing as true. [Friends of Hitler](https://www.timesofisrael.com/full-official-record-what-the-mufti-said-to-hitler/) (hopefully this isnât breaking the rules since it is directly related to the topic) are obviously not going to have the best, or reliable, views on Jews. 

Now, instead of pointing out other flaws, I just want to commend you on attempting to do your own research. It is important, even though your research was lacking proper scrutiny, to recognize that you ended up with a conclusion that is somewhat correct; Israel has wronged Palestinians at points along history. I donât think anyone should label themselves as 100% either side, that only sows division and leads nowhere. I wish more anti-Zionists would take your approach and try learning about history instead of the alternate reality most live in which has lead to their hatred of Jews (some, not all.

Literally Hamas. At this second there's a generous ceasefire deal on the table ***from Israel*** that Hamas is not agreeing to. And instead of committing to ceasefire talks, Hamas decided to launch rockets out of a civilian base in Rafah into the Kerem Shalom border. Seriously dude, this is what Israel is up against. A bunch of suicidal and genocidal morons.

Hamas more than likely will not sign the deal talks happening in Cairo this weekend, because they have insane demands that can't be met, and because they want Rafah to be invaded. Hamas needs more Gazans dead so they can continue to gain global support and sympathy. I would bet money that Hamas leaders will ultimately reject these most recent ceasefire talks happening. They couldn't even last through a 3 day ceasefire to exchange hostages back when.

*-Â So 'colonisation' is 'inaccurate' but a withdrawal from Gaza is 'insane'?*

Correct. Israeli civilians have no desire to move into Gaza, occupy the space, and live there. This is a war. In order for the war to end, Israel needs to know that the second they pull out of Gaza there won't be hundreds of militants coming out of the tunnels and flying rockets / parachuting into their border. Hamas refuses to ensure that.

*-not a primary goal of the student protests, a big part of which is divestment of funds*

Which goes to show that these protests are not about ""peace"" or ending the war, it's about their extreme hatred for Israel &amp; Israelis/Zionists. They don't care about the fact that Hamas surrendering in a war they started and releasing their remaining hostages would immediately end the war. They care that Israel has some U.S money ties.

Well.. yes. Just like history classes in America are from American view of history.

&gt;full of propaganda.

That's not quite true. We've been taught about the Nakba in school, for example.

&gt;Refutation: how can you expect the Arabs to just leave their land so easily?

1. It wasn't their land. The vast majority of the land in Mandatory Palestine was State-owned land. And let us not forget Jews are native to that region as well. 

2. They didn't need to leave, had the war of 1947-1949 not have happened, no one would've been forced to leave, and Israel would've been established as a state with 40% Arabs.

&gt;Refutation: the Israeli deal sucked; if only Barak made more concessions, there would have been peace;

Arafat left negotiations, he didn't have to accept whatever Barak gave him, but he could've negotiated. Same happened in 2008, 1993, 1947...

&gt;Refutation: Israeli left settlements, but it did not leave the minds of the Palestinians. Gaza was an impoverished, open-air prison, blockaded by Israel. The idea that it could turn into Singapore in a matter of years is ridiculous. The Israelis want to blame the Palestinians for pretty much everything wrong with Palestine. They want to say, look, we Israelis have been so good to you, but you cannot even do the most basic right things. The Israelis say that the Gazan children learn propaganda in schoolbooks. This is true, but so do Israelis.

The blockade on Gaza was placed *after* Hamas rose to power, and launched missiles into Israel. Not before. And the terms for lifting it were simple - recognize Israel, and accept peace. 

As for propaganda, sure we learn a version of history from our perspective, but we aren't taught to hate Arabs, Palestinians or Muslims.

&gt;Many Israelis have an irrational fear that they are surrounded by enemies that want to destroy them. Actually, Israel is far stronger militarily than its neighbors. It is Lebanon that is always scared that Israel will invade.

So? Our fear is justified, given.. 2005 - 2024 (all the rounds with Hamas), 2006 (Second Lebanon war), 2000 - 2002 (second Intifada), 1989 - 1993 (first Intifada), 1982 (first Lebanon war), 1973 (Yom Kippur war), 1967 (Six Day war), 1948 war, etc...

So while we are more powerful, we aren't the ones who initiated all those wars. So yes, we are surrounded by enemies that would love to destroy us, it is not an irrational fear.

&gt;6. Israelis do not see themselves as occupiers, even though there is a lot of evidence of occupation in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem.

Because this is our homeland. We've won all those regions in defensive wars. Jerusalem is our holiest city, many places in the old city were built by Jews 2,000 years ago. The entire land is ""littered"" with Jewish/Hebrew/Israelite archeology.

The WB is disputed territory, Jerusalem was annexed, and we left Gaza nearly 20 years ago.

&gt;But so few people in Israel care about the plight of the Palestinians.

The Palestinians have brought that on themselves by going to a ""war of extermination"" (in their own words), instead of choosing peace.

&gt;They just think of the Palestinians as terrorists.

Not all of them, sure. But when 72% of the population supports Hamas, it's difficult to ""love"" them..

&gt;I support the existence of a Palestinian state and if Israelis want peace they will have to find a way to live with the Palestinians, not destroy them.

Peace will come when the Arabs would love their children more then they hate us.

 It is not the Israelis who need to find a way to live with the Palestinians.  There are 2,000,000 Arabs living in Israel peacefully. Yet not a single Jew in PA areas/Gaza.

The Palestinians must drop the mindset of ""from the river to the sea"" if they want their own state. Their freedom can't be dependent on our ruin.

&gt;The more I read about Israeli history, the more I have concluded that *many of the problems that Israel faces when it comes to Gaza and the West Bank have largely been created by Israel.*

Like what? Let's see.. Israel agreed to a 2SS, the Arabs rejected, went to war, lost. The Arabs then declared another war against Israel, and lost again. This time, instead of expelling the population of the territory Israel conquered (like they did previously), they left them there, as their intention was to have a ""land for peace"" deal. Except the population never accepts Israel's right to exist, and they become more violent. So Israel puts restrictions on them in order to save its own lives, which causes more violence, which causes more restrictions, and so on. 

Now, how's that Israel's fault? For the cycle to end the Palestinians must stop fighting, which would lead to Israel easing the restrictions.

&gt;. Trying to ""show them who's boss"" does not work. Going into Rafah is a huge mistake.

Israel should've gone into Rafah months ago. And yes, showing who's boss does work - look at the results of the 1948 war vs the results of the 1967 war.

No moderate Pro-Palestinian tries to argue for a 2SS based on the resolution 181. Yet most people ask for a 2SS based on the June 1967 borders. Israel was significantly more aggressive (= the Nakba) back in 1948 compared to 1967.

&gt; Weapons will not bring peace. This conflict has been going on for 75 years. Armed force is not the answer.Â Have we learned anything from the ""War on Terror""? ""Our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism. Military force usually has the opposite effect from what is intended: It is often overused, alienates the local population by its heavy-handed nature, and provides a window of opportunity for terrorist-group recruitment."" Source: *How Terrorist Groups End,* RAND report.

Since the Palestinians were the first to pick up arms, they should he the first to put them down. If the Arabs were to lay down their weapons, there would be peace.

&gt;9. The conflict will only end when Israel makes more steps to end the Gazan blockade and remove settlers from the West Bank. Israel should give up the land that was taken from the Palestinians in 1967. Israel could have decided to give the Palestinians a state in 1967. Instead, it declined and has become an occupying power ever since.

No. The ""occupation"" is just an excuse for violence. Why would Israel returning to 1967 borders change anything? Hell, we were at the 1967 borders, back in 1967! So why was there war? Why did the Arabs go for a ""war of extermination"" and refused to have peace with Israel?

Their revolution is a revolution for the sake of revolution. They could've had a state countless times before, they refused. 

Where's Israel's guarantee that if it unilaterally leaves the WB, it won't just turn into another Gaza? Israel unilaterally left Gaza, all we got October 7th - after 18 years of constant bombardment from the Gaza strip.

1384,2/10/2024 21:51,"&gt;Gaza isn't even a prison,

Let us (me) be smart here and correct you because its funny how colonizers try to justify colonization. 

Number 1 bestie: since 2007, Israeli authorities have, with narrow exceptions, banned Palestinians from leaving through Erez, the passenger crossing from Gaza into Israel, through which they can reach the West Bank and travel abroad via Jordan.

Number 2 bestie: Israel also prevents Palestinian authorities from operating an airport or seaport in Gaza.

Number 3: Israeli authorities also sharply restrict the entry and exit of goods, like coriander and diapers? Why??? And that was before October 7, before they were starving babies and children and pregnant mothers to [death](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/07/world/gallery/gaza-hunger-malnutrition/index.html). Like it was so bad that the Israeli government was forced to [conduct a study to estimate calorie count going into Ghaza](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19975211). 


Now tell me how the restriction of access to food, the control over food and water supplies, the obstruction of airport and seaport construction, and the near-total closure of passages into and out of Gaza do not amount to anything other than imprisonment. 

When a territory is annexed, subjected to apartheid policies, colonized, and its population imprisoned in such a manner, you have to be absolutely mentally enslaved and cognitively dissonant to not recognise these actions for what they truly are. 

These measures go beyond mere control; they systematically strip away basic human dignities and freedoms. How can one argue that this is not equivalent to operating a large-scale prison?

Bestie its fine to do those things, but don't justify it. Just admit that you're a colonizer :) and you'll be treated as such.

&gt;Nobody wants a people that what ever country they go to try to coup the government.

The egyptian government has been systematically oppressing its own people for years, let alone Ghazans. The government of Egypt is like Israel in a sense. The people would love to welcome Palestinians onto their land UNDER better circumstances, not when they're being ethnically cleansed. 

And the Egyptian government is unfortunately trying to monopolise off the terrorism Israel is afflicting onto Ghazans by asking for obscene amounts of money for entry into Egypt. 

And why should the default be that they leave through Egypt? This is a sovereign nation. If only Israel would allow Ghaza its own airports and seaports without bombing them 24/7.

Let me educate you. The rockets were shot in retaliation to the outbreak of the situation in theÂ West BankÂ after settlers kidnapped the Palestinian child Muhammad Abu Khudair in occupied Jerusalem on July 2, 2014, tortured and burned him alive.

However, the occupation forcesâ re-arrest of dozens of editors of the âShalitâ deal, and representatives of the Palestinian Legislative Council from the Hamas movement, revealed thatÂ IsraelâsÂ decision to attack the Gaza Strip for the third time aims to destroy the capabilities of the Palestinian resistance factions, the Stripâs infrastructure, and citizensâ homes and property, in order to incite them against those factions.

2: Israeli laws promote the creation of Jewish communities but has not created as single community for Israeli Arabs.   
3: The law of return applies to Jews only despite Arabs having proof of habitation pre-1948.  
4: When Arab Israeli's sued for transporation to schooling in their language (which Jewish Israeli's are legally entitled to) the court [ruled](https://www.timesofisrael.com/carmiel-is-a-jewish-city-court-tells-arab-students-seeking-transportation/): "" âKarmiel is a Jewish city intended to solidify Jewish settlement in the Galilee.

Itâs been almost seven months since the start of the U.S.-backed Israeli genocide in Gaza, which has claimed â at minimum â tens of thousands of Palestinian lives, including at least 15,000 children. There is mass starvation in the north, countless mass graves are being found every day from where the Israelis have withdrawn and a ground invasion of Rafah, which is under heavy bombardment, is still on the books. Despite all this and the growing domestic pressure on the U.S. government to change course, Joe Biden and his administration have shown no desire to choose a different course. Instead, unlike the media narrative that puts blame squarely on Netanyahu, this administration is showing what Joe Biden has shown throughout his career: complete deference to and support of the state of Israel.

Thanks for letting the mask slip and exposing your self as a full on Jew hating anti semite.  With that in mind letâs pick apart your disinformation filled post.  

White phosphorus.   Sorry no itâs not restricted like you lay out.    Itâs not to be used to directly target civilian targets and care is to be used if itâs deployed on military targets located within concentrations of civilians.   If you can provide a source (that isnât hamas or their stooges) that shows that the Israelis actually directly targeted civilians with WP in this current conflict Iâd be happy to read it.  

Hamas doesnât hate Jews.   Well you might want to let them know they should make some changes to their charter where they clearly say they want to kill all Jews.  Constantly having press conferences declaring they will destroy Israel and all the Jews in it doesnât really help you case either.  

Before 1948 all the Muslims , Jews and Christians were happily living together.    A quick web search for massacres in Palestine will return a long list of them from the start of the British mandate to when it ended.  

Jewish capitalists stirred up trouble and controlled European governments.  Do I need to even respond to this?   Do you keep a copy of Mein Kamph under your pillow?

No peace until âthe resistanceâ grows and gets more members and finally takes everything over.   That kind of thinking is exactly why the Palestinians are in the situation they are in.   And with every big attack wave they start they end up with less and less.   Keep brain washing your child soldiers with your fantasies and keep crying victim when your evil schemes blow up in your face over.   

You can win over some Tik Tok warriors but the people in power know exactly who you are and you are doomed to fail over and over.

* Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejected a new outline for the release of hostages, drawn up by Mossad head David Barnea, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Major General Nitzan Alon. This was announced this evening (Tuesday) on Kan 11. According to the report on Kan 11, after the rejection of the outline, Maj. Gen. Alon - who is in charge of the hostages' issue on behalf of the IDF - decided not to go to the negotiations in Cairo.  
According to the report, the outline came up several times in talks with the prime minister, and came up the last time in a limited consultation with the participation of Netanyahu, Gallant, and the three senior officials - hours before they left for Cairo. The new outline included changes in several parameters, but Netanyahu rejected it in the same conversation - and ordered the team to travel to Cairo anyway, ""to listen"".
* The Israeli delegation to Cairo returned this evening (Tuesday) from the follow-up talks to the Cairo hostage deal, which were defined as ""significant"".

A senior Egyptian official said that the mediators achieved ""relatively significant progress"" in the negotiations even before the meeting in Cairo of the representatives of Qatar, the US and Israel. The official claimed in a conversation with the AP news agency before the meeting that it would focus on formulating a ""final draft"" of an agreement that would include a six-week ceasefire , while promising that the parties will continue negotiations towards a permanent ceasefire.

Like their job, you know. Just as what's happened at Al shifa hospital! You know, instead of knocking down the hospital with a missile cause omg yes you can do that, I know shocker :O


The fact you ignore even the basics of how to avoid war crimes, something my father who is a marine will roar into your ear and will verbally strip you of dignity while he's at it, to believe that there is no other way is laughable!!


Despite allllll those many other ways of doing things to avoid war crimes, they are leaping into commiting them, and recording themselves doing it. Even destroying empty and cleared buildings IOF occupied after raiding it.



You got your tldr, Que examples and eventually the how to find them, if you can even read this much.



The slew of video documentation of them literally targeting civilians walking, them targeting the world food guys who had been given clear clearance and were clearly marked and told their exact location.Â 
How about that time they sniped a whole family leaving a child alive in the car, then killing marked rescuers who had been given the clear, and then killing another pair of rescuers after they had gone through the exact same steps, and then finally killing the child still trapped in the car.
How about the mutiple times they gunned down civilians getting food from a truck.
How about the time they used white phosphorus, a war crime bty and there is videos and photos of it.
Or the type of missiles they use that are intentionally made to spin and shred, or cause significant damage.
Are you going to pull an Israel and tell me once more that it was tunnels again, or the debunked 40 beheaded babies that the reporter later retracted??


How about targets that hadn't had any weapons in them?

Why target a playground with kids on it
Why target nearly every universityÂ 
Why target nearly every hospital and execute thousands of patients who were confirmed not to be hamas, yes they sent soldiers in to do that bty, its happened at Al shifa hospital! You know, instead of knocking down the hospital with a missile cause omg yes you can do that, I know shocker :O



I can go on, and on about their iron dome, their security, the types of weapons they use, their available and detailed surveillance that prevents much of their so called oopsies and the long and arduous noncombatant targets they record themselves shooting or bombing.
Or the number of clearly marked (and documented to be their job with no history of association with Hamas) press personnel they've assassinated for daring to show Israeli war crimes.



**They absolutely DO NOT need to destroy as much infrastructure as they have, and they've said, yes their government said, their goal is to completly wipe out gaza and its people in order to settle it.**


Which, follow their actions step by step, makes all of what they've done, their moving of safe zones while also bombing said safe zones in order to kick them out (today its fromÂ Rafah into egypt today) make sense.


It's exactly as they have clearly documented wanting to do, documented what they've done, and you're plugging your ears and covering your eyes to the slew of evidence.


**Where to find the evidence because:**
You know where to find that evidence, and it is not being only shown on tiktok and telegram (tho unless you want a live leaks moment dont use tele), but tumblr, here on reddit, Twitter, and Instagram.



I will also suggest using DuckDuckGo as a search browser as google by now has mostly purged the algorithm of the topic to primarily promote only old American articles that are riddled with not only logical fallacies but a heavily doused slew of propaganda phrasing like describing murders in the most bizarre attempts at being soft accidents for Palestinians, and descriptive horror/shock for IOF.


It is intentional, DuckDuckGo at least opens you up to other countries as well as not filter out humanitarian organization statements, allowing a more open ability to research.

The fear in Israel is that the harsh statements against the Biden administration, among others by the Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir this morning in a tweet against the US President (""Hamas â¤ï¸ Biden""), will thwart this partial solution to the crisis.

If Israel used 7000 missiles and 13,000 dead and ~70% were noncombatants (if we take ""Gaza officials"" at their [word](https://archive.ph/WRtaD)) that's about 1.3 non-combatants per missile assuming 0 self-inflicted.

Well, thatâll be the excuse but letâs be honest itâs far from necessary. How many premature babies died in their incubators at a single hospital so that Israel could get in and kill Hamas terrorists?

You know what, letâs break down the numbers

[Washington Post says over 11,000 dead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2023/gaza-rising-death-toll-civilians/). In the same article, they state that over 4,600 children are a part of that total.

Four thousand, six-hundred children dead. Their crime is being near terrorists, or at least alleged to be near terrorists. But letâs assume for a moment, that itâs true. All four thousand, six hundred children were near a terrorist. How is that possible?

Gaza has an area of a little less than 140 square miles, twice the size of Washington DC. Which has a population of about 670k. Double that, you get 1.3 million. The population of Gaza outnumbers that by 700k people. Two million people living in an area just slightly bigger than twice the size of the capital of the worlds most powerful nation. Per square mile?

21,034 people per square mile. But whatâs a number without some context?

New York City, one of the biggest most heavily populated cities in the world, has a density of 29,303. NYC, btw, has a population four times as many as Gaza and is packed into a square mile area twice as big as Gaza. 

NYC packs four times the population into an area over twice as big as Gaza, and only manages to outpace Gaza by 8,000 people per square mile.

Two million people. Some 25k of those are members of Hamas, give or take Iâm sure a certain number who are outside of Gaza, Iâm sure someone has those numbers but Iâm not them. All I know is that maximum estimates are that there are 25,000 members of Hamas. For simplicities sake, theyâll all located in Gaza and they form part of the two million population. 

1.25% of the total population. 

Letâs jump tracks for a second.

After world war 1, the League of Nations, the precursor to the UN, issued whats known as the British Mandate, basically ordering/allowing for Jewish immigrants to move to the area. This had already been happening for a few decades, but this greatly does dÃºo the process. The area was, of course, already occupied. But anyone whoâs ever lived in an area undergoing gentrification knows that you donât get a choice in the matter, and tensions escalate. Then, post world war 2, the UN issued a partition plan. And for our audience that knows anything about 1947 India/PakistÃ¡n, you should know about how well that went down. But weâre talking about Israel/Palestine at the moment, and it went down about as well as it did for India/Pakistan. 

A year after that, we got the first Arab-Israeli war. At the end, an armistice was reached and Israel then occupied an extra 78% of land that it didnât occupy before. In two years, they expanded by almost 80%. Twenty years later, in 1967, they expanded to their current borders. 

I donât know about the laws in the West Bank and if they apply differently there than they do to Gaza. But people in Gaza are not free to leave. 24 miles of coastline blocked by the Israeli Navy, a grounding of the majority of not total air traffic, and a land blockade means that no one is getting out. Even prior to all this, travel in and out has been severely restricted. 

So, back to the population numbers.

How do you get four thousand six hundred children within the radius of an air strike explosion aimed at 1.25% of the total population?

By designing your laws in such a way that itâs unavoidable that theyâll be that close to each other.

The Israelis have warned Gazans to move south of Gaza city to avoid the incoming land invasion and increased bombing. Over half the population will be displaced and packed into an even smaller area than theyâre already in. But Iâm sure this time, once Israel secures the area, theyâll give it back to the Palestinians, right?

Any other person should understand that October 7 was wrong and Israel now has to defend itself. In order to make a safer war, we should also PRAISE all the actions taken to MINIMIZE civilians lives and CONDEMN all the actions taken to MAXIMIZE civilian casualties.

1. Evacuate 250k Israeli civilians from the Gaza envelop and the north.

2. Use iron domes to protect Israeli civilians from Hamas indiscriminate bombing.

3. Send leaflets with warnings to evacuate the Palestinians to the south where they genuinely hit significantly less than the north. Over 1 million Palestinian have evacuated. Hamas told the Palestinians these leaflets are Israeli propaganda.

4. Design routes for evacuation. Hamas blocked these routes with cars and sniper shot Palestinians who tried to evacuate.

5. Open humanitarian corridors in midst of battle! Protecting Gaza civilians from Hamas while risking Israeli soldiers' lives. Over 100k Palestinians have used these corridors. Hamas attacked the Israeli soldiers while they protected the Palestinian civilians. Israel continue opening these corridors on a daily basis.

6. Donate water to southern Gaza and allow aid in Gaza. Hamas stole the aid.

7. Avoid hitting Shifa hospital and other hospitals that are protecting Hamas headquarters.

8. Calling (via phone) to Palestinian people and ask them to evacuate before attacking.

2. you are using talking points now of details of oct7 that is considered debunked by one side and fact by the other. this is radicalization in exercise regardless of which side is correct. as well, the continued oppression of gaza is a continuum of reality for palestinians.

3. false reading of statistics. as point 2 discussed: palestinians do not believe in the extend of atrocities committed by hamas. the narrative of rape, of beheading, of torture, are only prevalent in the west. to draw parallel: overwhelming amount if Israeli advocate the current devastation against Gaza is not enough firepower.

6. whether WB abide by Israel law is inconsequential to how a human being should be treated. whether you accept the current consensus that WB is occupied or not, nothing denies human rights and dignity if not under the Geneva convention concerning occupied territories, or the universal declaration of human rights concerning everything. the conversation of Jordan reclaiming WB is also mired by the problem of settlements.

- to draw parallel here: you express that you do not want WB while some express WB should belong to ""greater Israel"". some Palestinians say they don't want to take back Israel, some say they want it as ""historical Palestine"".

7. international community considered Gaza to be effectively occupied as Israel controls of various degrees borders, airspace, waterways, natural resource, electromagnetic sphere, energy, economy, tax, trade, aid deliveries. the Rafah crossing to Egypt is officially controlled by Egypt but everything through that place requires green-light of Israel.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Its funny that Gaza has two land borders. One controlled by Israel and one by Egypt which is a Islamic Arab country. However only the border controlled by Israel matters to you but the one controlled by Egypt does not... 

Of course it does matter. Despite officially, it is under Egypt's control, Israel exerts significant control and pressure over the Rafah border. I'll explain why below. 

Although officially Egypt controls it, Israel has consistently used the Rafah Crossing by closing it to exert pressure on the PA and Hamas whenever it feels like it. It has closed the crossing to gain concessions when a problem rises. Some examples are during 2008 when Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Israel used the crossing to force Hamas to release him otherwise the crossing will remain closed indefinitely. Senior Defence Ministry Official Amos Gilad said so himself

[""If Gilad Shalit is not released, Rafah crossing does not open,""](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3557573,00.html)

Another Israeli news network, Haaretz also published the same thing:

[https://www.haaretz.com/2006-08-30/ty-article/israel-using-rafah-crossing-to-pressure-pa-on-shalit-release/0000017f-db2d-d3ff-a7ff-fbade2730000](https://www.haaretz.com/2006-08-30/ty-article/israel-using-rafah-crossing-to-pressure-pa-on-shalit-release/0000017f-db2d-d3ff-a7ff-fbade2730000)

That's weird. Why should Israel have the right to open and close the Rafah Crossing when Egypt is supposed to be in charge? 

Anyone who wants to enter the Rafah border crossing also has to get permission and a Palestinian ID confirmed by Israel in the Palestinian Registry which itself is a confirmation of in-direct control over who gets in and gets out. Egypt doesn't give the visas and IDs for Palestinians who want to enter but rather Israel. There are only four exceptions to this case that being diplomats, humanitarian agencies, investors and humanitarian emergencies. Anyone else who isn't part of this group must get an ID and visa confirmation from Israel which takes a long time. If Israel doesn't confirm and allow an ID to enter, then that person can't do so despite being approved by the Egyptian side.

As Israeli organization Gisha says:

*Israel exercises ultimate control over the opening of Rafah Crossing and has used that control periodically to close Gaza to the outside world. In order for Rafah Crossing to open, EU monitors and PA officials must be present at the crossing, and Israeli security officials must staff the situation room which monitors the crossing through cameras. Israeli consent and cooperation are required for Rafah Crossing to open, because the agreement for opening the crossing requires the participation of Israeli, Palestinian, and European officials and because Israel controls whether EU monitors will reach Rafah by issuing security warnings, telling the EU monitors whether or not they may staff their positions at Rafah on a given day.* 

*Indeed, if Israel refuses to permit a foreigner to enter Gaza through the excepted categories, that person may not enter.*

Or maybe the [1834 Safed Pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1834_Safed_pogrom)? Jews have been living in Israel for millennia (albeit a minority), and were often massacred by their ""loving"" neighbors, be they Arab or other.

Only since the 1930s when Jewish numbers grew due to immigration did Jews start to defend themselves. Look at [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_and_massacres_in_Mandatory_Palestine) of massacres in British Mandate Palestine, you will see the perpetrators begin off all Arab, and then around the late 1930s it switches to the Jews.

But who doesn't like to root for the underdog? So let's root for the losers of multiple wars that decided who rules the land (never mind who initiated those wars)?

Has Israel been an angel throughout? No. Should Israel have been established in the way it was, with the intention of driving out the other locals? Probably not. Should Israel keep their military occupation of the WB going? No, as this leads to more desperation and struggle. Should Israel remove their security measures (which make the occupation unbearable)? No, as these measures were only put in place as a response to the Intafadas and other suicide/terror attacks targeting civilians, removing them endangers their population. Should Israel annex Israel and give WB Arabs full rights? It sounds nice, but it effectively would mean an Arab majority, so Israel would be dissolving itself.

Can a 2 state solution work? No, definitely not if your slogan is ""from the river to the sea Palestine will be free"" - ""by any means necessary"" (including slaughter). Not if Hamas's founding charter is the slaughter of Jews worldwide. Not with decades of an official âPay for Slayâ policy by the Palestinian Authority, in which the PA prioritized paying salaries to terrorists who murdered innocent Jews above all else â the more Jews they kill, the greater the financial reward they receive.

The comments appeared to emerge from an off-record briefing for foreign journalists conducted by military officials.

An unnamed IDF official cited by AP says that at least 15,000 Palestinians in Gaza have died since the outbreak of the war on October 7. The army says it estimates more than 5,000 of the Gaza deaths to be Hamas terrorists.

AFP quotes an unnamed Israeli official: âIâm not saying itâs not bad that we have a ratio of two to one,â noting that the use of human shields was part of Hamasâs âcore strategy.â

âHopefully, \[the ratio\] will be much lowerâ in the coming phase of the war, the official adds, noting that âin the south, because we have basically doubled the population, operations are much more precise.â

The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said earlier today that around 15,900 people have been killed so far in the Strip.

Yesterday. 

The total number given the Gaza Health Ministry, even if Hamas run, has not been disputed in any of the previous engagements since 2008. You can argue about the breakdown of militant vs civilian, but that isn't relevant to the total death count, which is the basis of my post above.",Neutral

Strike location was 180m from the nearest shelter. Thatâs almost two football fields. There is simply no way two 17 kg / 35 lbs munitions could kill anyone that far without secondary explosions of ammo in place. From the weight, and also Hagari describing it as the smallest missile the aircraft can carry, this sounds like a locally developed Rafael Spike variant. 

Soâ¦ what red lines? Hamas continues to lie and get their people killed as they always had. This incident has a very similar taste to the infamous âhospital strikeâ. The condemnations were thunderous, but the retractions merely a whisper. And BBC just straight up said they have no regrets for the bad coverage.",Pro-Israel
1488,11/16/2023 10:39,"1. The German policy was fairly generic, and in line with what other countries were doing at the time. Might I remind you that a lot of countries, United States and Canada included brought back funding for the UNRWA in the 2010's. 

&gt;*Deutsche Zahlungen an die PalÃ¤stinenser und an UNRWA (das Hilfswerk der Vereinten Nationen fÃ¼r PalÃ¤stina-FlÃ¼chtlinge im Nahen Osten) wurden nicht nur wieder aufgenommen, sondern sogar deutlich erhÃ¶ht â ungeachtet von Warnungen und Fakten.*

when? The article simply says that they increased payments, but when? Was this in the late 2010's? After October 7? It doesn't say. 

  
*2.* I feel like there's a lot of missing context. Like, looking at the articles youve cited, 

&gt;*Baerbock trifft sich in der Westbank (Westjordanland) kritiklos mit TerrorunterstÃ¼tzern; die verbale, finanzielle, ideelle und mediale UnterstÃ¼tzung der Hamas und des Terrors wird von ihr nicht thematisiert. Die Ministerin kritisiert Israel an falschem Ort und inhaltlich an der falschen Stelle.*  
*...*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Sie ignoriert vorangegangene Abkommen, insbesondere, was die Gebiets- bzw. Aufgabenaufteilung in der Westbank betrifft, wie auch die damit verbundenen rechtlichen Unterschiede zwischen den A- und C-Gebieten. A steht fÃ¼r Zonen unter palÃ¤stinensischer Selbstverwaltung, C fÃ¼r Zonen, die vom israelischen MilitÃ¤r gesperrt sind und nicht zu den Autonomiegebieten gehÃ¶ren.*

Like, I feel like its leaving out a lot of information. Who are these ""terrorist supporters"", how does she ignore the division(s) of the West Bank? 

3. I mean is she wrong? Pretending like October 7 waqs just some one-off thing that Hamas randomly decided to do because ""kill the jews"" helps nobody, and ultimately does more harm than good. NOTHING ever happens in a vacuum. In the same way that the change in Israeli policy towards the Palestine issue did not happen in a vacuum, October 7, and the wider shift among Palestinians towards militancy did not happen in a vacuum either.

4. Where has she criticized Israel for not letting aid through? From what I can find, whenever she mentions aid, she doesn't blame Israel for the aid etc.

&gt;*Es wird immer klarer: Die israelische Armee muss mehr tun, um die Zivilistinnen und Zivilisten in Gaza zu schÃ¼tzenâ, sagte Baerbock nach den Unterredungen. Die Armee âmuss Wege finden, die Hamas zu bekÃ¤mpfen, ohne dass so viele palÃ¤stinensische Menschen Schaden erleidenâ, sagte Baerbock.*  
  
*Die Ministerin beklagte âdas Leid vieler unschuldiger Menschenâ im Gazastreifen und forderte: âWir brauchen eine weniger intensive OperationsfÃ¼hrung.â Zudem appellierte Baerbock fÃ¼r eine Ausweitung der KapazitÃ¤ten fÃ¼r Hilfslieferungen nach Gaza. In den vergangenen drei Monaten starben im Gazastreifen nach palÃ¤stinensischen Angaben bereits Ã¼ber 22 000 Menschen, jedes dritte Opfer ist laut Hilfsorganisationen ein Kind. Baerbock bekrÃ¤ftigte zwar auch Deutschlands UnterstÃ¼tzung fÃ¼r Israels Selbstverteidigung: âDas legitime Selbstverteidigungsrecht Israels im Rahmen des humanitÃ¤ren VÃ¶lkerrechts verteidigt Deutschland international Ã¼berallâ, sagte die Ministerin. In Israel stoÃen die Appelle nach MÃ¤Ãigung bei der MilitÃ¤roperation in Gaza dennoch auf wenig Begeisterung.*

Like hello? Are we reading the same articles?

&gt;*Doch Baerbock Ã¼bt auch Kritik an der KriegsfÃ¼hrung Israels: Â»Es wird immer klarer, dass die israelische Armee mehr tun muss, um Zivilisten in Gaza zu schÃ¼tzen. Sie muss Wege finden, die Hamas zu bekÃ¤mpfen, ohne dass so viele palÃ¤stinensische Menschen Schaden an Leib und Leben erleiden.Â«*  
  
*Mehr als die HÃ¤lfte der HÃ¤user im Norden Gazas seien beschÃ¤digt oder zerstÃ¶rt. Fast zwei Millionen Menschen sind auf der Flucht. Â»Hunger und Durst sind entsetzlicher Alltag, und Seuchen breiten sich aus. Die Menschen werden nicht ausreichend versorgtÂ«, hebt die AuÃenministerin hervor und plÃ¤diert erneut fÃ¼r MitgefÃ¼hl: Wer sich vorstelle, es seien die eigenen AngehÃ¶rigen, kÃ¶nne dazu nicht schweigen. Â»Sie brauchen Nahrung, sie brauchen sauberes Wasser und medizinische Versorgung. DafÃ¼r hat Deutschland seine humanitÃ¤re Hilfe seit Kriegsbeginn auf mehr als 200 Millionen Euro verdreifacht.Â«*  
  
*Das, was an finanziellen Mitteln und GÃ¼tern bereitsteht, mÃ¼sse allerdings auch durchkommen. Doch das sei derzeit noch zu wenig. Die GrenzÃ¼bergÃ¤nge Rafah im SÃ¼den und Keren Shalom im Norden seien regelrechte FlaschenhÃ¤lse.*

6. She said that they should shift to lower intensive operations, and said that more aid should go into Gaza, from both Rafah (Egypt) and the crossings on the Israeli end. Not to mention, Israel bombing the ""safe zones"", and Palestinians being forced into smaller, and smaller areas with nowhere to go. 

7. This is not some controversial whatever position. Even the US has repeatedly said that the PA should take over. And again,k they said that it needs to be ""reformed"". The Palestinian martyr fund funds terrorism yes, but that's not its explicit goal. It just ends up doing that through the lack of will, or inability to change the paramaters of who qualifies for the fund. and as such, terrorists tend to get that money more often than not.",Neutral

&gt;The Israel Defense Forces announces the death of Cpl. Noa Marciano, who was captured by the Hamas terror group on October 7.  
&gt;  
&gt;Marciano, 19, of the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps 414th, served in the Nahal Oz base when it was overrun by terrorists during the onslaught.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yesterday, Hamas published a propaganda video of the soldier, showing her speaking to the camera four days after being taken hostage. The video then cuts to her dead body.  
&gt;  
&gt;The IDF recognizes her as a âfallen soldier held captive by a terror group.â

Edit: Pro-Hamas supporters are claiming it's an IDF airstrike. Having seen the gruesome video it's definitely [not](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17uvt3j/comment/k9738iy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

1494,11/7/2023 7:58,"Contrary to the claims of the Palestinians - the killing of senior Hamas officials was carried out in the Rafah area, and not in the safe zone defined by the IDF.

The place of execution of senior Hamas officials in Rafah is near UNRWA warehouses in the west of the city - areas 2371 and 2372 - more than a kilometer away from the safe zone.

And this is in contrast to the Palestinians claims that the IDF bombing was in the safe zone (they cannot utter a word without lying!

â«ï¸the elimination zone is marked in red near the UNRWA warehouses,

â«ï¸the elimination zone in red on the IDF evacuation map and the safe zone in purple,

Not only did they not evacuate to the safe zone, they also serve as a human shield for senior Hamas officials and then they lie and claim that the IDF attacked in the safe zone!
